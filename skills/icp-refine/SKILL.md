# /octave:icp-refine - ICP Intelligence

## Run the task

Read [the task method](references/task-method.md) before selecting context, claims, or output. It is the execution method for this skill. Supporting templates supply structure and styling; populate them from the task method and current evidence, not their illustrative figures or assertions.

Use pursued and closed outcomes with denominators. Separate fit, readiness, execution, commercial constraints and unknowns. Validate proposed criteria on held-out cases before applying scoped changes. A missing champion or budget is not automatically a fit exclusion.

Use [GTM context](../shared/gtm-context.md) for strategic tasks and [evidence and inputs](../shared/evidence-and-inputs.md) for material claims and missing facts. A narrow list/get or a render-only handoff does not require unrelated research. Read [host runtime](../shared/host-runtime.md) for available tools, portable resource paths, routing, and review fallback.

Resolve current tool schemas before execution; use returned IDs and pagination. Inventory rows locate records; hydrate selected entities/resources before relying on their contents. Reuse supplied or inherited context and authorization. Ask grouped questions only for material unresolved inputs, continue independent work, incorporate replies, and recheck affected output.

## Usage

```
/octave:icp-refine [--period <days>] [--segment <name>] [--focus wins|losses|both]
```

## References by task

- [refinement report template](references/refinement-report-template.md)

Read only the reference for the selected mode, then the format/layout references when rendering. Do not repeat intake or change approved claims when routing to a renderer.

## Delivery and changes

Apply [output readiness](../shared/output-readiness.md) to text and artifacts. HTML also uses the [review protocol](../shared/protocol.md) and the matching format checks. A working preview can be shared with its status; unrun checks are NOT RUN. Reviewers return findings on an immutable version; one author applies edits and rechecks the final version.

For visual output, inherit the selected sender/workspace brand through [brand kit usage](../shared/brand-kit-usage.md); honor an explicit override and avoid repeated brand extraction. Public hosting requires the approved audience and publish manifest, followed by URL/access/link verification.

For comparisons, trends or rates, use the [analytics contract](../shared/analytics-contract.md). Only requested persistence loads [workspace mutations](../shared/workspace-mutations.md); report changes as applied only after scoped readback.
