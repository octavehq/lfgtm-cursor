name: brief
description: Account dossier and call prep document rendered as a scannable HTML reference page for internal use. Use when user says "brief me on [company]", "account dossier", "call prep doc", "background on [person]", or asks for an internal reference document. Do NOT use for customer-facing documents — use /octave:one-pager or /octave:proposal instead.

# /octave:brief - Account Dossier & Call Prep Builder

Build beautiful, self-contained HTML account briefs powered by your Octave GTM intelligence. Designed to sit on your second monitor during a call or to review before a meeting. Unlike plain-text research, briefs render as scannable, styled reference documents with sticky navigation, collapsible sections, and print-friendly layout — grounded in real enrichment data, Motion ICP narrative, proof points, and conversation intel.

This is an **internal** document for the sales team, not customer-facing collateral.

**Key differentiators:**
- vs `/octave:research` — research outputs plain text; brief renders it as a styled, scannable HTML document
- vs `/octave:one-pager` — one-pager is customer-facing; brief is internal prep
- vs `/octave:deck` — deck is a slide presentation; brief is a scrollable reference document

## On-brand styling — use a brand kit if one exists

Before generating, decide whose brand this brief should match (usually the **target company**; sometimes your own company). Then:

1. Resolve the company to a `<slug>` and check for a cached brand kit at `~/.octave/brands/<slug>/manifest.json`.
2. **If a kit exists →** offer it: *"I found a saved brand kit for <Company> — want this brief rendered in their brand?"* If yes, style the output with the kit instead of a generic preset:
   - inline the kit's `tokens.css` (`:root` + the embedded `@font-face`) **and** `get-brand-components/assets/kit_base.css` into the output `<style>`;
   - follow `brand-kit.md` → **Signature moves**, and reuse the kit's real **logo**, `images/`, and `icons.json`;
   - for doc-shaped output you can compose directly with `get-brand-components/scripts/render_kit.py` (hero / split / logos / pricing / cta / footer blocks).
3. **If no kit exists →** offer to build one first: *"No brand kit for <Company> yet — want me to capture it (~1 min) so this is on-brand?"* → run `/octave:get-brand-components <domain>`, then proceed.
4. **If the user declines →** generate with the default style/preset.

> The brand kit is the strongest styling signal — when one is available, prefer it over generic `--style` presets. See the `get-brand-components` skill for the kit format, token contract, and renderer.

## Optional review pass

After generating the asset, **offer** an optional review (don't force it): *"Want me to run a quick review pass over this — layout, brand, narrative, groundedness, and AI-slop?"* If yes, follow [`get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md`](../get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md): render/screenshot the output, inspect it across the five dimensions (render the pixels and actually look — overflow and white-on-white only show in the render), report a short scorecard of specific located findings, then fix and re-verify. Skip silently if the user declines.

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:brief`:

### Step 1: Understand the Context

**Identify the target:**
- Email address -> Person-targeted brief (enrich person + company)
- Domain -> Company-targeted brief (enrich company + find key contacts)
- LinkedIn URL -> Person-targeted brief
- Meeting description -> Extract company/people from context

**Detect or ask occasion:**

If `--for` not specified, infer from context or ask:

```
What are you preparing for?

1. Discovery call — First conversation, qualifying the opportunity
2. Demo — Showing the product, proving value
3. Follow-up — Continuing a conversation, advancing the deal
4. QBR — Quarterly business review with existing customer
5. Executive meeting — High-level strategic conversation
6. Deal review — Internal review of opportunity status
7. General dossier — Comprehensive account reference

Your choice:
```

Each occasion changes which sections are emphasized and which are de-emphasized or omitted. See the section emphasis table in Step 4.

### Step 2: Octave Context Gathering

Based on the target and occasion, use Octave MCP tools to build a complete intelligence picture. **Tell the user what you're researching and why.**

**Call as many tools as needed to build a thorough brief.** The best briefs layer multiple sources — company enrichment + person enrichment + Motion ICP narrative + proof points + conversation intel all combine to create a document grounded in real data. Don't stop at one tool when several would give you a stronger brief.

Not every tool applies to every brief. Use your judgment about which are relevant to *this specific* situation. The tables below show what's available — pick the combination that gives you the richest context for the occasion and target.

**List vs Search — when to use which:**

| Tool | Purpose | Use when... |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `list_all_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch all entities of a type (minimal fields) | You want a quick inventory — "show me all our competitors" |
| `list_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch entities with full data (paginated) | You need the actual content — "get full proof point details" |
| `get_entity({ oId })` | Deep dive on one specific entity | You found something relevant and need the complete picture |
| `search_knowledge_base({ query })` | Semantic search across library + resources | You have a concept or question — "how do we position for healthcare?" |
| `list_resources()` / `search_resources({ query })` | Uploaded docs, URLs, Google Drive files | You need reference material, uploaded assets, or source docs |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `list_*` when you know *what type* of thing you want. Use `search_*` when you know *what topic* you're looking for.

**Follow-up briefs — ground them in what actually happened:**

If this brief follows a previous interaction with the account (follow-up, QBR, deal review), pull findings and events to anchor the brief in real data rather than generic positioning:

- `list_findings({ query: "<company or contact>", startDate: "<relevant period>" })` — surfaces what was actually said in calls: objections raised, features requested, pain points confirmed, competitor mentions
- `list_events({ filters: { accounts: ["<account_oId>"] } })` — deal stage changes, meetings held, emails sent — shows the journey so far
- `get_event_detail({ eventOId })` — deep dive on specific events (e.g., the discovery call, the demo) to pull exact context

This turns a generic "here's what we know" brief into "here's what happened and what to do about it" — much more useful walking into the next conversation.

#### For Person-Targeted Briefs

Start with person and company enrichment, then pull positioning context:

| What you need | Tool | When to use |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| Person deep-dive | `enrich_person({ person: { email, firstName, lastName, companyDomain } })` | Always for person-targeted briefs — gives background, role, priorities |
| Company profile | `enrich_company({ companyDomain })` | Always — gives industry, size, tech stack, signals |
| ICP fit (person) | `qualify_person({ person: { ... } })` | When you need persona match and fit assessment |
| ICP fit (company) | `qualify_company({ companyDomain })` | When you need segment match and ICP scoring |
| Additional contacts | `find_person({ searchMode: "people", companyDomain, fuzzyTitles })` | When you want to map the broader buying committee |
| Find Motion | `list_motions()` | List all Motions to find the relevant offering + motion type |
| Persona × segment matrix | `list_motion_icps({ motionOId })` | See the persona × segment cells available under a Motion |
| Motion ICP narrative | `find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId, includeLearnings: true })` | Pull the full Target ICP overview, Strategic narrative, Pains and consequences, Benefits and impacts, Methodology, References, and Learning Loop learnings for the target persona × segment |
| Proof points | `list_entities({ entityType: "proof_point" })` | Fetch all proof points with full data — metrics, quotes, logos |
| References | `list_entities({ entityType: "reference" })` | Customer references with full details |
| Competitive context | `search_knowledge_base({ query: "<signals>", entityTypes: ["competitor"] })` | When competitor is mentioned or likely in the deal |
| Recent intel | `list_findings({ query: "<company or person>", startDate: "<90 days ago>" })` | Conversation-based insights from past interactions |
| Deal history | `list_events({ filters: { accounts: ["<account_oId>"] } })` | Timeline of deal events |
| Synthesized prep | `generate_call_prep({ companyDomain })` | Quick comprehensive brief to use as a starting point |

---

#### For Company-Targeted Briefs

Start with company enrichment and contact discovery:

| What you need | Tool | When to use |
|---------------|------|-------------|

---

Does this look good? I can:
1. Proceed to style selection and generation
2. Add or remove sections
3. Go deeper on any area
4. Change the occasion / emphasis
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Style Selection

The brief uses the same CSS variable / style preset system as `/octave:deck`. Full preset definitions are in the deck skill's [style-presets.md](../deck/references/style-presets.md).

Briefs default to readability-optimized presets. If `--style` was not provided, ask:

```
Pick a style for your brief:

1. midnight-pro     — Dark navy, white text, blue accents (default for briefs)
2. paper-minimal    — Off-white, black type, editorial simplicity
3. executive-dark   — Charcoal + gold, premium boardroom aesthetic
4. soft-light       — Warm white + sage green, calm and approachable
5. swiss-modern     — White + red accent, Bauhaus minimal
6. Use my brand     — Extract from website or provide colors
7. Match my deck    — Use the same style as an existing /octave:deck

Your choice (or press Enter for midnight-pro):
```

| Occasion | Recommended Default |
|----------|-------------------|
| Discovery | `midnight-pro` |
| Demo | `midnight-pro` |
| Follow-up | `paper-minimal` |
| QBR | `executive-dark` |
| Executive | `executive-dark` |
| Deal review | `paper-minimal` |
| General | `midnight-pro` |

If the user selects "Use my brand," follow the brand discovery flow from the deck skill (website extraction via browser-use or WebFetch, manual fallback). If they select "Match my deck," ask for the deck file path and extract its CSS variables.

### Step 4: Generate HTML

Build a single self-contained HTML file. The brief is a scrollable reference document — not a slide deck. Natural page scroll, sticky sidebar navigation, collapsible sections, and a print-friendly layout.

#### Output Directory

```
.octave-briefs/
└── <kebab-case-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
    └── <name>.html
```

Example: `/octave:brief acme.com --for discovery` -> `.octave-briefs/acme-discovery-2026-02-11/acme-discovery.html`

The `.octave-briefs/` directory should be in `.gitignore`.

#### Document Sections (Full Dossier)

Not all sections appear in every brief. The occasion determines emphasis:

| Occasion | Emphasized Sections | De-emphasized / Omitted |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Discovery | Company Snapshot, ICP Fit, Talking Points (questions), Playbook, Qualification | Deal Timeline, Competitive |
| Demo | Stakeholders, Value Props, Proof Points, Competitive, Demo Flow | ICP Fit detail |
| Follow-up | Recent Signals, Deal Timeline, Talking Points (next steps), Open Items | Company Snapshot (condensed) |
| QBR | Deal Timeline, Recent Signals, Proof Points, Value Delivered | ICP Fit, Playbook |
| Executive | Company Snapshot (concise), Key Stakeholders, Value Props, Strategic Angles | Technical details, granular signals |
| Deal Review | Deal Timeline, Competitive, Risk Assessment, Stakeholder Map, Next Steps | Company Snapshot (condensed) |
| General | All sections at equal weight | None |

**Section definitions:**

1. **Header** — "Account Brief: [Company]" + generation date + occasion badge (pill label like "Discovery Prep" or "QBR Brief")
2. **Company Snapshot** — Company name, logo (if available), industry, employee count, HQ location, funding stage, tech stack highlights, recent news/signals. Card-based layout.
3. **ICP Fit** — Fit score with a visual progress bar, matched segment name, 3-5 key fit reasons as checkmarks, any red flags as warnings.
4. **Key Stakeholders** — Cards for each person: name, title, LinkedIn URL, matched persona, inferred priorities, communication style notes. Highlight the primary contact.
5. **Recommended Playbook** — Playbook name, strategic angle, key themes to drive. Brief summary of the recommended approach.
6. **Talking Points** — Occasion-specific content:
   - Discovery: open-ended questions organized by category (rapport, pain exploration, qualification, future state)
   - Demo: recommended flow, features to highlight, proof points to weave in
   - Follow-up: recap of what was discussed, open items, proposed next steps
   - QBR: value delivered, metrics to highlight, expansion opportunities
   - Executive: strategic themes, board-level talking points, concise value narrative
7. **Value Props to Lead With** — 3-4 value props tailored to this account, each with a headline, supporting evidence, and a "say this" phrasing.
8. **Competitive Landscape** — If competitors detected: comparison table with key differentiators, landmine questions to ask, traps to avoid. Omit if no competitive signals.
9. **Proof Points to Reference** — Relevant case studies with metric highlights, customer quotes, and logo. Organized by relevance to this account's industry/size/use case.
10. **Recent Signals** — From findings: what was said in calls, objections raised, features requested, sentiment indicators. Each signal has a date and source. Omit if no findings data.
11. **Deal Timeline** — If existing deal: visual stage history (horizontal timeline or vertical step list), key events, current stage, days in stage, next milestone. Omit for new prospects.
12. **Quick Reference** — Sticky sidebar or footer cheat sheet: key facts at a glance, do's and don'ts for this conversation, one-line reminders. Always visible while scrolling.

#### HTML Architecture

See [html-architecture.md](references/html-architecture.md) for the full HTML scaffold, inline CSS, and key differences from deck HTML.

#### Content Density Guidelines

Briefs are reference documents, not presentations — they can hold more content per section than slides. But keep it scannable:

| Section | Content Limit |
|---------|--------------|
| Company Snapshot | 6-8 data fields in cards, 3-5 recent signals |
| ICP Fit | Score bar + 5 fit reasons max |
| Key Stakeholders | 4-6 stakeholder cards max |
| Talking Points | 8-12 talking points grouped by category |
| Value Props | 3-4 value props with evidence |
| Competitive | Comparison table with 4-6 rows max |
| Proof Points | 3-5 proof point cards |
| Recent Signals | 5-8 most relevant findings |
| Deal Timeline | 6-10 timeline events |
| Quick Reference | 8-12 key facts / reminders |

If a section would exceed its limit, prioritize by relevance to the occasion and trim the rest.

### Step 5: Delivery

After generating the HTML file:

1. **Open the brief** in the default browser
2. **Present a summary:**

```
BRIEF READY

## Error Handling

**Octave Connection Failed:**
> Could not connect to your Octave workspace.
>
> The brief builder needs Octave data to generate useful content. Without it, most sections would be empty.
>
> To reconnect: check your MCP configuration or run `/octave:workspace status`

**Company Not Found:**
> I couldn't find detailed intelligence for [domain].
>
> Options:
> 1. Check the domain spelling and try again
> 2. Try a different domain or company name
> 3. Provide company details manually and I'll structure the brief

**Person Not Found:**
> I couldn't find detailed information for [email/name].
>
> I found their company ([Company]). Would you like me to:
> 1. Proceed with company research + generic persona guidance
> 2. Search for them on LinkedIn (provide URL)
> 3. Create a brief based on their title and company alone

**No Matching Motion ICP:**
> No Motion ICP cell matches this audience profile directly.
>
> I'll use general positioning from the knowledge base. Consider creating a Motion for this offering, or layering a Custom Motion Playbook (Thematic / Milestone / Account / Competitive) onto an existing Motion to cover this segment.

**No Findings Data:**
> No conversation signals found for [company/person].
>
> This may be a new prospect with no prior interactions. I'll skip the Recent Signals and Deal Timeline sections and focus on enrichment data, Motion ICP narrative, and proof points instead.

**No Proof Points:**
> No proof points found in your library.
>
> The Proof Points section will be omitted. To strengthen future briefs, add case studies and customer references to your Octave library.
