description: Generate visual win/loss analysis reports as self-contained HTML with CSS-based charts and data visualizations. Use when user says "win/loss report", "deal report", "visual analysis", or wants a formatted HTML version of deal outcome analysis. Do NOT use for text-based deal analysis — use /octave:wins-losses instead.

# /octave:win-loss-report - Visual Win/Loss Report Builder

Generate beautiful, self-contained HTML win/loss analysis reports powered by your Octave deal intelligence. Unlike `/octave:wins-losses` which outputs text-based analysis, this skill renders structured visual reports with CSS-based charts, progress indicators, comparison bars, and metric cards -- designed for leadership reviews, team retrospectives, and strategic planning.

Uses the same CSS variable / style preset system as `/octave:deck`.

## On-brand styling — use a brand kit if one exists

Before generating, decide whose brand this report should match (usually the **target company**; sometimes your own company). Then:

1. Resolve the company to a `<slug>` and check for a cached brand kit at `~/.octave/brands/<slug>/manifest.json`.
2. **If a kit exists →** offer it: *"I found a saved brand kit for <Company> — want this report rendered in their brand?"* If yes, style the output with the kit instead of a generic preset:
   - inline the kit's `tokens.css` (`:root` + the embedded `@font-face`) **and** `get-brand-components/assets/kit_base.css` into the output `<style>`;
   - follow `brand-kit.md` → **Signature moves**, and reuse the kit's real **logo**, `images/`, and `icons.json`;
   - for doc-shaped output you can compose directly with `get-brand-components/scripts/render_kit.py` (hero / split / logos / pricing / cta / footer blocks).
3. **If no kit exists →** offer to build one first: *"No brand kit for <Company> yet — want me to capture it (~1 min) so this is on-brand?"* → run `/octave:get-brand-components <domain>`, then proceed.
4. **If the user declines →** generate with the default style/preset.

> The brand kit is the strongest styling signal — when one is available, prefer it over generic `--style` presets. See the `get-brand-components` skill for the kit format, token contract, and renderer.

## Review pass (runs by default)

After generating, **run the review pass by default** — don't wait to be asked. In interactive mode, tell the user at intake that you'll review before finishing (recommended) and that they can opt out with `--skip-review` or "skip review". Follow [`get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md`](../get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md): the always-on **preflight** (em dashes, broken images/logos, link `target`, themed scrollbars, leaked internals) plus the **visual pass** (render/screenshot, inspect the pixels across the dimensions — groundedness/verification matters most — report a short located scorecard, fix, re-verify). The visual pass defaults off only in a `--research fast` run; the preflight always runs.

When generating, follow the output rules in [`get-brand-components/references/presentation-principles.md`](../get-brand-components/references/presentation-principles.md) — the generation-time companion to the review pass (label every value, no tool names in the output, confirmed vs hypothesized, lean and deal-specific).

## Usage

```
/octave:win-loss-report [--period <timeframe>] [--segment <filter>] [--competitor <name>] [--style <preset>]
```

## Examples

```
/octave:win-loss-report                                          # Last 90 days, all deals
/octave:win-loss-report --period "Q4 2025"                       # Specific quarter
/octave:win-loss-report --competitor "Gong"                      # Focused on deals vs Gong
/octave:win-loss-report --segment "enterprise"                   # Enterprise segment only
/octave:win-loss-report --period "last 6 months" --style paper-minimal
/octave:win-loss-report --period "2025" --competitor "Salesforce" --segment "mid-market"
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:win-loss-report`:

### Step 1: Define Scope

If not provided via flags, ask the user interactively:

**Period -- "What time range?"**

```
What time range should this report cover?

1. Last 30 days
2. Last 60 days
3. Last 90 days (default)
4. Last 6 months
5. Specific quarter (e.g., Q4 2025)
6. Custom date range

Your choice:
```

**Filter -- "Any specific focus?"**

```
Do you want to filter the analysis?

1. All deals -- full cross-deal analysis
2. Specific competitor -- focus on deals involving a competitor
3. Specific segment -- filter by market segment
4. Specific rep -- filter by sales rep
5. Custom filter -- describe what you want

Your choice:
```

If competitor or segment is selected, use `list_all_entities` to show available options:

```
# For competitor filter
list_all_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })

# For segment filter
list_all_entities({ entityType: "segment" })
```

**Depth -- "How detailed?"**

```
What level of detail?

1. Executive summary -- 1-page overview with key metrics and takeaways
2. Full report -- detailed analysis with all sections and drill-downs

Your choice:
```

| Depth | Sections Included | Best For |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Executive summary | Header, Summary, Win Rate, Win Patterns (condensed), Loss Patterns (condensed), Recommendations | Board updates, weekly stand-ups |
| Full report | All 12 sections | QBRs, strategy sessions, enablement |

### Step 2: Octave Data Gathering

Based on scope, use Octave MCP tools to gather comprehensive deal intelligence. **Always tell the user what you're researching and why.**

**Call as many tools as needed to build a complete picture.** Win/loss reports are only as good as the data behind them. Layer multiple data sources -- deal outcomes + conversation findings + library context -- to produce analysis grounded in real evidence, not speculation.

See [tool-reference.md](references/tool-reference.md) for list-vs-search guidance and the tool reference tables for core deal data, conversation intelligence, library context, and competitor-focused data.

**Output of this step:** Present a report outline to the user for approval before generating. See [outline-template.md](references/outline-template.md) for the outline template.

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Style Selection

Reports default to clean, data-focused light themes. Ask the user:

```
Which style for the report?

LIGHT THEMES (recommended for reports)
  1. paper-minimal     -- Off-white + black type. Editorial simplicity. (default)
  2. soft-light        -- Warm white + sage green. Calm and approachable.
  3. swiss-modern      -- White + red accent. Bauhaus minimal.

DARK THEMES
  4. midnight-pro      -- Dark navy, white text, blue accents.
  5. executive-dark    -- Charcoal + gold. Premium boardroom.
  6. octave-brand      -- Octave purple on dark navy.

Or provide a number/name from the full preset list (12 options in style-presets.md).

Your choice (default: paper-minimal):
```

Full CSS variable definitions for each preset are in [style-presets.md](../deck/references/style-presets.md).

### Step 4: Generate HTML

Build a single, self-contained HTML file. **No external dependencies except Google Fonts.** Everything else inlined.

#### Output Directory

Reports go under `.octave-reports/`:

```
.octave-reports/
└── win-loss-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
    └── win-loss-report.html
```

Example: `/octave:win-loss-report --period "Q4 2025"` produces `.octave-reports/win-loss-2026-02-11/win-loss-report.html`

The `.octave-reports/` directory is in `.gitignore` -- nothing here gets committed.

#### HTML Architecture

See [html-architecture.md](references/html-architecture.md) for the HTML architecture, structural requirements, and the CSS component system (metric cards, win rate ring, bar charts, progress bars, takeaway cards, pattern cards, deal cards, recommendation cards, data tables, trend indicators).

#### Report Sections (Full Report)

See [sections.md](references/sections.md) for the full 12-section report breakdown and the condensed executive summary variant.

### Step 5: Delivery

After generating the HTML file:

1. **Open the report** in the default browser
2. **Present a summary:**

```
REPORT READY
=============

File:    .octave-reports/win-loss-<date>/win-loss-report.html

## Error Handling

**No Deal Data in Period:**
> No won or lost deals found for [period].
>
> This could mean:
> 1. CRM integration isn't syncing deal outcomes
> 2. The date range has no closed deals
> 3. Filters are too restrictive
>
> Try:
> 1. Expand the date range
> 2. Remove filters (competitor, segment)
> 3. Check your Octave CRM integration settings

**Insufficient Data (Fewer Than 5 Deals):**
> Only [N] deals found for [period]. Win/loss analysis is most useful with 5+ deals.
>
> Options:
> 1. Proceed anyway -- I'll generate the report with available data (patterns may be unreliable)
> 2. Expand the time period to capture more deals
> 3. Remove filters to include all segments/competitors

**No Findings Data:**
> Deal outcomes found, but no conversation findings available.
>
> The report will include deal metrics and outcomes but won't have:
> - Evidence quotes from calls
> - Objection analysis
> - Value prop effectiveness
>
> For richer analysis, ensure calls are being recorded and findings extraction is enabled in Octave.

**Octave Connection Failed:**
> Could not connect to your Octave workspace.
>
> The win/loss report requires deal data from Octave. Check your MCP configuration or run `/octave:workspace status`.

**Missing Competitor/Segment Data:**
> I couldn't find a competitor named "[name]" in your library.
>
> Available competitors:
> - [List from list_all_entities]
>
> Pick one from the list, or proceed with "all deals" and I'll break down by competitor automatically.
