# /octave:train - Sales Training Ground

Practice and learn your GTM playbooks and Motion ICPs through interactive role-play simulations and knowledge quizzes — all grounded in your real library data. Role-play against buyer personas with realistic objections, or quiz yourself on value props, competitive positioning, and discovery techniques.

## Usage

```
/octave:train [mode] [--persona <name>] [--competitor <name>] [--difficulty easy|medium|hard]
```

## Modes

```
/octave:train                                          # Interactive - pick a mode
/octave:train roleplay                                 # Simulate a buyer conversation
/octave:train roleplay --persona "CTO"                 # Role-play with a specific persona
/octave:train roleplay --scenario discovery            # Practice discovery calls
/octave:train quiz                                     # Test your GTM knowledge
/octave:train quiz --topic objections                  # Quiz on objection handling
/octave:train quiz --competitor "Acme"                 # Competitive knowledge check
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:train`:

### Step 1: Choose Mode

If no mode specified, ask:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What do you want to practice?",
    header: "Train mode",
    options: [
      { label: "Role-Play", description: "Simulate a sales conversation — I'll play the buyer and give you feedback" },
      { label: "Quiz", description: "Test your knowledge of personas, objections, value props, and competitive positioning" },
      { label: "Guided Learning", description: "Walk me through a topic from your Motion ICP narrative — teach me like I'm a new hire" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

---

### Mode: Role-Play

Simulate realistic buyer conversations using persona data from the library.

#### Step RP-1: Setup the Scenario

Ask for scenario parameters (use `AskUserQuestion` for structured choices):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What scenario do you want to practice?",
      header: "Scenario",
      options: [
        { label: "Discovery call", description: "First conversation — qualify the opportunity and uncover pain" },
        { label: "Objection handling", description: "Practice responding to tough objections mid-deal" },
        { label: "Demo pitch", description: "Present your product's value to a skeptical buyer" },
        { label: "Competitive displacement", description: "Sell against a competitor the buyer currently uses" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    },
    {
      question: "How tough should I be?",
      header: "Difficulty",
      options: [
        { label: "Friendly", description: "Interested buyer, open to learning — good for building confidence" },
        { label: "Skeptical (Recommended)", description: "Realistic buyer who pushes back and needs convincing" },
        { label: "Hostile", description: "Tough buyer — time-pressed, has objections, hard to impress" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

If no persona specified, present available personas:
```
# Get personas from library
list_entities({ entityType: "persona" })
```

Ask:
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Which buyer persona should I play?",
    header: "Persona",
    options: [
      { label: "[Persona 1 name]", description: "[Title] — [key concern]" },
      { label: "[Persona 2 name]", description: "[Title] — [key concern]" },
      { label: "[Persona 3 name]", description: "[Title] — [key concern]" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

#### Step RP-2: Load Persona Intelligence

```
# Get full persona details
get_entity({ oId: "<persona_oId>" })

# Find the matching Motion ICP cell (persona × segment) for messaging context
list_motions()
list_motion_icps({ motionOId: "<motion_oId>" })
find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId: "<motion_icp_oId>", includeLearnings: true })

# Get real objections from conversations (to make role-play realistic)
list_findings({
  query: "objections pushback concerns",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>",
  eventFilters: {
    personas: ["<persona_oId>"]
  }
})

# Get product details
list_entities({ entityType: "product" })
get_entity({ oId: "<product_oId>" })

# Get competitor details (for competitive scenarios)
get_entity({ oId: "<competitor_oId>" })  // if competitive scenario

# Get proof points (to evaluate if rep uses them)
search_knowledge_base({ query: "<persona> results metrics", entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"] })
```

#### Step RP-3: Set the Scene

Present the scenario context, then begin:

See [roleplay-scene-template.md](references/roleplay-scene-template.md) for the role-play scene template.

**Run the conversation with the shared role-play engine** — [roleplay-mechanics.md](../shared/roleplay-mechanics.md) defines how to play the buyer at each difficulty tier, session length (8-12 exchanges), and natural endings. Train-specific grounding:
- Reference real pain points from the persona entity
- Raise real objections from conversation findings data (`list_findings`)
- In competitive scenarios, use the competitor entity's strengths as the buyer's talking points

#### Step RP-4: Scorecard

After the role-play ends, provide detailed feedback following the scorecard mechanics in [roleplay-mechanics.md](../shared/roleplay-mechanics.md):

See [roleplay-scorecard-template.md](references/roleplay-scorecard-template.md) for the role-play scorecard template.

### Mode: Quiz

Test knowledge of the user's own GTM library.

#### Step Q-1: Choose Topic

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What do you want to be quizzed on?",
    header: "Quiz topic",
    options: [
      { label: "Personas", description: "Pain points, priorities, buying triggers, and how to sell to each persona" },
      { label: "Objection handling", description: "Common objections and how to respond — from your Motion ICP narratives and real conversations" },
      { label: "Competitive positioning", description: "Differentiators, trap questions, and counters for each competitor" },
      { label: "Full GTM review", description: "Mix of everything — personas, products, value props, objections, competitors" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

Also ask for quiz format:
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What format?",
    header: "Format",
    options: [
      { label: "Rapid fire (Recommended)", description: "Quick question-answer, 10 questions, scored at the end" },
      { label: "Scenario-based", description: "Situational questions — 'A prospect says X, what do you do?'" },
      { label: "Deep dive", description: "Fewer questions but explain your reasoning — I'll coach you on each answer" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

#### Step Q-2: Load Quiz Material

```
# Load based on topic
# For Personas:
list_entities({ entityType: "persona" })
get_entity({ oId: "<persona_oId>" })  // for each persona

# For Objections:
list_findings({
  query: "objections pushback concerns pricing",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>"
})
list_motions()
list_motion_icps({ motionOId: "<motion_oId>" })
find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId: "<motion_icp_oId>", includeLearnings: true })

# For Competitive:
list_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })
get_entity({ oId: "<competitor_oId>" })  // for each competitor

# For Full GTM:
list_entities({ entityType: "persona" })
list_entities({ entityType: "product" })
list_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })
search_knowledge_base({ query: "value propositions proof points" })
list_entities({ entityType: "use_case" })
```

#### Step Q-3: Run the Quiz

Run questions with the shared quiz engine — [roleplay-mechanics.md](../shared/roleplay-mechanics.md) defines question pacing, per-answer grading, and running-score display.

See [quiz-formats.md](references/quiz-formats.md) for the rapid fire, scenario-based, and deep dive quiz format templates with question types per topic.

#### Step Q-4: Quiz Results

See [quiz-results-template.md](references/quiz-results-template.md) for the quiz results template.

### Mode: Guided Learning

Walk through a topic from the library like a training session.

#### Step GL-1: Choose Topic

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What do you want to learn about?",
    header: "Topic",
    options: [
      { label: "A persona", description: "Deep walkthrough of how to sell to a specific buyer type" },
      { label: "A competitor", description: "Learn competitive positioning, differentiators, and counters" },
      { label: "A Motion", description: "Walk through a Motion's Default Motion Playbook (persona × segment matrix) plus any Custom Motion Playbooks" },
      { label: "Your product", description: "Master your product's capabilities, use cases, and proof points" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

#### Step GL-2: Load and Teach

Fetch the relevant entity and present it as a structured training walkthrough:

```
# Load the entity
get_entity({ oId: "<entity_oId>" })

# Load related Motion + ICP cell
list_motions()
list_motion_icps({ motionOId: "<motion_oId>" })
find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId: "<motion_icp_oId>", includeLearnings: true })

# For the "A Motion" topic, also walk the Motion's playbooks
list_motion_playbooks({ motionOId: "<motion_oId>" })
get_motion_playbook({ motionPlaybookOId: "<mp_oId>" })  // Default + any Custom playbooks

# Load real conversation examples
list_findings({
  query: "<topic>",
  startDate: "<180 days ago>"
})

# Load proof points
search_knowledge_base({ query: "<topic>", entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"] })
```

See [guided-learning-template.md](references/guided-learning-template.md) for the interactive guided learning lesson template.

## MCP Tools Used

### Library Context

## Error Handling

**No Personas in Library:**
> No personas found in your library.
>
> Role-play and quizzes work best with persona data.
> Add personas first: `/octave:library create persona`
>
> I can still run a general sales quiz using your product info.

**No Conversation Data:**
> No conversation data available yet.
>
> I'll use your library data for role-play and quizzes.
> As your team logs calls and emails, training will get richer
> with real-world objections and patterns.

**No Competitors:**
> No competitors in your library.
>
> Competitive quizzes and displacement role-plays need competitor data.
> Add competitors: `/octave:library create competitor`
>
> I can still quiz you on personas, value props, and general objection handling.

**Sparse Library:**
> Your library has limited data for a full training session.
>
> Start with:
> 1. `/octave:library create product` - Add your product
> 2. `/octave:library create persona` - Add buyer personas
> 3. `/octave:library create competitor` - Add competitors
>
> Even with just a product and one persona, I can run basic training.
