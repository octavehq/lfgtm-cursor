### Step 2: Query Deal Data

**For Overview:**
```
# Get won deals
list_events({
  eventTypes: ["DEAL_WON"],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  limit: 50
})

# Get lost deals
list_events({
  eventTypes: ["DEAL_LOST"],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  limit: 50
})

# Get findings from won deals
list_findings({
  opportunityStatus: ["WON"],
  extractionTypes: [
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_OBJECTIONS",
    "CALL_INTERNAL_VALUE_PROP_PRESENTATIONS",
    "CALL_INTERNAL_PROOF_POINTS",
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_COMPETITORS_TO_OUR_OFFERING"
  ],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  limit: 100
})

# Get findings from lost deals
list_findings({
  opportunityStatus: ["LOST"],
  extractionTypes: [
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_OBJECTIONS",
    "CALL_INTERNAL_VALUE_PROP_PRESENTATIONS",
    "CALL_EXTERNAL_COMPETITORS_TO_OUR_OFFERING"
  ],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  limit: 100
})
```

**For Competitor Analysis:**
```
list_findings({
  extractionTypes: ["CALL_EXTERNAL_COMPETITORS_TO_OUR_OFFERING", "EMAIL_COMPETITOR_MENTION"],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" },
  entityMatches: {
    competitorOIds: ["<competitor_oId>"]
  }
})
```

**For Deal Deep Dive:**
```
list_events({
  eventTypes: ["DEAL_WON", "DEAL_LOST", "CALL", "EMAIL"],
  companyDomains: ["<domain>"]
})

list_findings({
  companyDomains: ["<domain>"]
})

get_event_detail({
  eventOId: "<event_oId>",
  includeTranscript: true
})
```

### Step 3: Analyze Patterns

Aggregate findings across won/lost deals:

```
list_findings({
  eventTypes: ["DEAL_WON", "DEAL_LOST"],
  dateRange: { start: "<period start>", end: "<today>" }
})
```

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, offer actionable next steps:

```
Based on this analysis, I recommend:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
-----------------
1. Create Competitor A TCO battlecard section
   → /octave:pmm battlecard --competitor "Competitor A" --focus pricing

2. Update Motion ICP discovery guidance with budget qualification
   → update_motion_playbook with new methodology/objection content for the relevant Motion ICP cell

3. Review current pipeline for similar patterns
   → /octave:research --for pipeline-review

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
1. Consider pricing/packaging review for competitive segment
2. Create "pilot program" offer for price-sensitive deals
3. Develop CFO-specific value story
