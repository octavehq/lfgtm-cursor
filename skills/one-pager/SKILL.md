# /octave:one-pager - Personalized One-Pager Builder

Generate personalized, self-contained HTML one-pager documents (leave-behinds) powered by your Octave GTM knowledge base. Unlike generic templates, this skill enriches every section with real account intelligence -- company signals, persona pain points, Motion ICP cell narrative, and proof points -- to create a document that feels written specifically for the recipient.

One-pagers are single scrollable pages designed to be sent after a demo, meeting, or call. They summarize why your product is a fit for this specific account. Think of it as the document you email or print, not present.

## On-brand styling — use a brand kit if one exists

Before generating, decide whose brand this one-pager should match (usually the **target company**; sometimes your own company). Then:

1. Resolve the company to a `<slug>` and check for a cached brand kit at `~/.octave/brands/<slug>/manifest.json`.
2. **If a kit exists →** offer it: *"I found a saved brand kit for <Company> — want this one-pager rendered in their brand?"* If yes, style the output with the kit instead of a generic preset:
   - inline the kit's `tokens.css` (`:root` + the embedded `@font-face`) **and** `get-brand-components/assets/kit_base.css` into the output `<style>`;
   - follow `brand-kit.md` → **Signature moves**, and reuse the kit's real **logo**, `images/`, and `icons.json`;
   - for doc-shaped output you can compose directly with `get-brand-components/scripts/render_kit.py` (hero / split / logos / pricing / cta / footer blocks).
3. **If no kit exists →** offer to build one first: *"No brand kit for <Company> yet — want me to capture it (~1 min) so this is on-brand?"* → run `/octave:get-brand-components <domain>`, then proceed.
4. **If the user declines →** generate with the default style/preset.

> The brand kit is the strongest styling signal — when one is available, prefer it over generic `--style` presets. See the `get-brand-components` skill for the kit format, token contract, and renderer.

## Optional review pass

After generating the asset, **offer** an optional review (don't force it): *"Want me to run a quick review pass over this — layout, brand, narrative, groundedness, and AI-slop?"* If yes, follow [`get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md`](../get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md): render/screenshot the output, inspect it across the five dimensions (render the pixels and actually look — overflow and white-on-white only show in the render), report a short scorecard of specific located findings, then fix and re-verify. Skip silently if the user declines.

## Usage

```
/octave:one-pager <target> [--for <occasion>] [--style <preset>]
```

## Examples

```
/octave:one-pager acme.com                              # General one-pager for Acme
/octave:one-pager jane@acme.com --for demo-followup     # Post-demo leave-behind
/octave:one-pager acme.com --for discovery              # Post-discovery summary
/octave:one-pager "enterprise healthcare segment"       # Segment-level one-pager
/octave:one-pager acme.com --for renewal --style soft-light  # Renewal doc with specific style
/octave:one-pager jane@acme.com --for event-followup    # Post-conference/event follow-up
```

## Occasions

| Occasion | Output Focus |
|----------|--------------|
| `demo-followup` | Recap what was shown, reinforce value, clear next steps |
| `discovery` | Summarize pain points heard, position solution fit |
| `intro` | General company intro tailored to the account (default) |
| `event-followup` | Post-conference/event personalized summary |
| `renewal` | Reinforce value delivered, expansion opportunities |

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:one-pager`:

### Step 1: Understand the Context

If not provided via flags, ask the user interactively:

**Target -- "Who is this for?"**

```
Who is this one-pager for?

Provide any of the following:
- Company domain (e.g., acme.com)
- Person email (e.g., jane@acme.com)
- Segment description (e.g., "enterprise healthcare")

Target:
```

**Occasion -- "What's the context?"**

```
What's the occasion for this one-pager?

1. Demo follow-up - Sent after a product demo
2. Discovery follow-up - Sent after a discovery call
3. General intro - First touch or general positioning
4. Event follow-up - Sent after a conference/event meeting
5. Renewal - Reinforcing value for an existing customer

Your choice:
```

**Tone -- "What tone should it strike?"**

```
What tone fits best?

1. Formal executive - Polished, concise, boardroom-ready
2. Conversational - Warm, approachable, peer-to-peer
3. Technical - Data-driven, detailed, practitioner-focused

Your choice:
```

### Step 2: Octave Context Gathering

Based on target, occasion, and tone, use Octave MCP tools to build rich context for the one-pager. **Always tell the user what you're researching and why.**

**Call as many tools as needed to build a complete picture.** The best one-pagers come from layering multiple sources -- company enrichment + Motion ICP cell narrative + proof points + conversation intel all combine to create a document that feels genuinely personalized. Don't stop at one tool when three would give you a stronger narrative.

That said, not every tool applies to every one-pager. Use your judgment about which are relevant to *this specific* situation. The tables below show what's available -- pick the combination that gives you the richest context for the occasion and target.

See [tool-reference.md](references/tool-reference.md) for list-vs-search guidance, follow-up grounding tools, and the tool reference tables for account-specific and segment-level one-pagers.

**Output of this step:** Present a content outline to the user for approval. See [outline-template.md](references/outline-template.md) for the outline template.

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Style Selection

One-pagers use the same 12 style presets and brand extraction system as the deck skill. See [style-presets.md](../deck/references/style-presets.md) for full CSS variable definitions.

Ask the user:

```
How would you like to style the one-pager?

1. Pick from presets — 12 styles from dark executive to light minimal
2. Use a brand — mine (the sender) or the recipient's; extract from a website or provide assets
3. Auto-pick — I'll choose based on the occasion and tone
4. Surprise me

Your choice:
```

**Option 1: Preset Picker** -- Show the same preset table from the deck skill (see `/octave:deck` Step 4, Option 2).

**Option 2: Brand Extraction** -- Follow the same brand discovery flow from the deck skill (see `/octave:deck` Step 3): Tier 1 `get_external_brand_assets` (colors + logo, with a customer-logo sanity check), Tier 2 `scrape_website` with `includeScreenshot` for fonts + components, then browser-use / WebFetch / manual fallbacks. Confirm brand config with user before proceeding.

**Option 3: Auto-Pick** -- Map occasion + tone to recommended presets:

| Occasion + Tone | Recommended Preset |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Demo follow-up, formal | `midnight-pro` |
| Demo follow-up, conversational | `soft-light` |
| Discovery, formal | `executive-dark` |
| Discovery, conversational | `swiss-modern` |
| Intro, formal | `midnight-pro` |
| Intro, conversational | `soft-light` |
| Intro, technical | `electric-studio` |
| Event follow-up | `aurora-gradient` |
| Renewal, formal | `executive-dark` |
| Renewal, conversational | `soft-light` |

Tell the user what you picked and why. Let them override.

### Step 4: Generate HTML

Build a single, self-contained HTML file. **No external dependencies** except Google Fonts. This is a single scrollable document -- NOT slides.

#### Output Directory

Every one-pager gets its own folder under `.octave-one-pagers/`:

```
.octave-one-pagers/
└── <kebab-case-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
    └── <name>.html
```

Example: `/octave:one-pager acme.com` produces `.octave-one-pagers/acme-one-pager-2026-02-11/acme-one-pager.html`

The entire `.octave-one-pagers/` directory is in `.gitignore` -- nothing here gets committed.

#### HTML Architecture

See [html-architecture.md](references/html-architecture.md) for the HTML/CSS scaffold and key differences from the deck skill's HTML.

#### Document Sections

See [document-sections.md](references/document-sections.md) for per-section HTML templates (Header, The Challenge, Our Approach, Key Differentiators, Proof Points, Next Steps).

#### Content Density Rules

Keep it tight. A one-pager should be scannable in under 2 minutes:

| Section | Max Content |
|---------|------------|
| Header | Company name + title + date + "Prepared for" |
| The Challenge | 2-3 sentences max |
| Our Approach | 3-4 value props, each 1-2 sentences |
| Key Differentiators | 3 cards max, each heading + 1-2 sentences |
| Proof Points | 2-3 metrics or quotes |
| Next Steps | 1 CTA + contact info |

If content exceeds these limits, prioritize ruthlessly. The one-pager is a teaser, not a whitepaper.

### Step 5: Delivery

After generating the HTML file:

1. **Open the one-pager** in the default browser
2. **Present a summary:**

```
ONE-PAGER READY
================

Folder: .octave-one-pagers/<name>-<date>/
File:   .octave-one-pagers/<name>-<date>/<name>.html
Style:  [Preset name or "Custom Brand"]
Size:   [file size]

Viewing:
- Open in any browser -- single scrollable page
- PDF (recommended): bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}"/scripts/export-pdf.sh .octave-one-pagers/<name>-<date>/<name>.html  — or Cmd+P / Ctrl+P -> Save as PDF
- Email as attachment or save as PDF

Customization tips:
- Colors: Edit the :root CSS variables at the top of the file
- Content: Each <section class="section"> is one block
- Fonts: Change the Google Fonts <link> and font-family values
- Layout: Adjust max-width in .page for wider/narrower output

## Error Handling

**Octave Connection Failed:**
> Could not connect to your Octave workspace.
>
> The one-pager builder can still work without Octave -- you'll provide the content manually, and I'll handle structure, style, and HTML generation.
>
> To reconnect: check your MCP configuration or run `/octave:workspace status`

**Company/Person Not Found:**
> I couldn't find detailed intelligence for [target].
>
> Options:
> 1. Proceed with what we have -- I'll use general positioning from your library
> 2. Try a different domain or email
> 3. Provide the content manually and I'll build the one-pager

**No Matching Motion ICP Cell:**
> No Motion ICP cell matches this audience profile directly.
>
> I'll use your general positioning. After the one-pager is built, consider layering a Custom Motion Playbook (Thematic / Milestone / Account / Competitive) on the relevant Motion for this angle: `/octave:library create motion-playbook`

**No Proof Points Available:**
> No proof points found matching this account's industry or segment.
>
> Options:
> 1. Proceed without the proof points section
> 2. Use general proof points from your library
> 3. Provide customer results manually and I'll format them

**No Findings for Follow-Up:**
> No conversation findings found for [target] in the recent period.
>
> This means I'll build the one-pager from enrichment data and library content rather than grounding it in specific past conversations. You can provide meeting notes or context manually if you have them.
