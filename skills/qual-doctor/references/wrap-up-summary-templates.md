ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS
===================
- LIBRARY GAP: The agent picked "RevOps Leader" for a marketing person.
  You may need a more distinct persona for marketing ops roles.

- SECTION INCONSISTENCY: Product scores a company at 9 but the Motion ICP scores it
  at 2 (too large for the Motion ICP). Intentional or misaligned?

- DEEP RESEARCH: 3/5 test cases had LOW confidence on tool-usage questions.
  Enabling deep research on the agent would improve answer quality.
