# /octave:deck - Octave-Powered Deck Builder

Build compelling, self-contained HTML presentations powered by your Octave GTM knowledge base. Unlike generic slide builders, this skill leverages your library's personas, competitors, Motion ICP narratives, proof points, and real conversation data to research, structure, and generate presentations grounded in your actual go-to-market intelligence.

> HTML presentation engine inspired by [frontend-slides](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides) by Zara Zhang (MIT license). Decks render on a **fixed 1920×1080 stage scaled to the viewport** (see [references/viewport-base.css](references/viewport-base.css)).

## On-brand styling — brand kit first, then generate

**Resolve the brand before generating (do not skip this step).** The deck wears the **workspace company's brand** (the Octave customer whose workspace you are operating in): it is their presentation. A target company's logo can appear in content (a title slide, an account-context slide) but does not control the deck's design system. See [brand kit usage](../shared/brand-kit-usage.md) for the full whose-brand, lookup, and extraction flow.

1. Call `get_workspace_company` to identify the workspace company, resolve it to a `<slug>`, and check for a cached brand kit at `~/.octave/brands/<slug>/manifest.json`.
2. **If a kit exists →** use it by default (it is their own brand, no need to ask). Style the output with the kit instead of a generic preset:
   - inline the kit's `tokens.css` (`:root` + the embedded `@font-face`) **and** `../get-brand-components/assets/kit_base.css` into the output `<style>`;
   - follow `brand-kit.md` → **Signature moves**, and reuse the kit's real **logo**, `images/`, and `icons.json`;
   - for doc-shaped output you can compose directly with `../get-brand-components/scripts/render_kit.py` (hero / split / logos / pricing / cta / footer blocks).
3. **If no kit exists →** offer to build one first: *"No brand kit for <Company> yet — want me to capture it (~1 min) so this is on-brand?"* → run `/octave:get-brand-components <domain>`, then proceed.
4. **If the user declines →** generate with the default style/preset.

> The brand kit is the strongest styling signal — when one is available, prefer it over generic `--style` presets. See the `get-brand-components` skill for the kit format, token contract, and renderer.

> **Never approximate brand assets.** Always use actual logo files from `~/.octave/brands/<slug>/`. Never create placeholder SVGs or simplified wordmarks as stand-ins. If no logo exists and the deck needs one, tell the user and offer to capture brand components first. Same applies to fonts: verify that the brand's actual font families are loaded, not just generic fallbacks.

## Principles

Follow these standards during generation. Read each before producing output.

**Content and language:**
- [Editorial rules](../shared/editorial-rules.md) — no AI-isms, banned vocabulary, honest analyst tone
- [Information principles](../shared/information-principles.md) — lead with conclusions, evidence-backed claims, narrative arc

**Visual design:**
- [Presentation principles](../shared/presentation-principles.md) — typography, layout, visual restraint
- [Slide deck format](../shared/formats/slide-deck.md) — one idea per slide, action titles, progressive disclosure

**Octave data:**
- [Octave value](../shared/octave-value.md) — prioritize grounded workspace data over generic AI content

**Review loop (mandatory gate):** After generating, run up to 3 self-review passes against all principles checklists before delivering, per the [review protocol](../shared/protocol.md). This is a mandatory gate: do not ask whether to review, and do not deliver until the review comes back clean. See Step 5b.

## Usage

```
/octave:deck [topic or file] [--for <purpose>] [--audience <target>] [--style <preset>]
```

## Examples

```
/octave:deck "pitch for Acme Corp"                          # Customer pitch, Octave researches Acme
/octave:deck "Q1 QBR for enterprise segment"                # QBR with real pipeline data
/octave:deck --for competitive "vs Gong"                     # Competitive presentation
/octave:deck "product launch GTM plan"                       # Internal strategy deck
/octave:deck ~/Downloads/existing-deck.pptx                  # Convert PPTX to HTML
/octave:deck "demo day pitch" --style octave-brand           # Specific style preset
/octave:deck "sales kickoff enablement" --audience "new AEs" # Audience-targeted
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:deck`:

### Step 1: Understand the Purpose & Goal

If not provided via flags, ask the user interactively using AskUserQuestion:

**Purpose — "What kind of deck is this?"**

```
What kind of deck are you building?

1. Customer pitch / pre-demo deck
2. Customer QBR / business review
3. Internal strategy / planning
4. Conference talk / keynote
5. Product launch / GTM plan
6. Competitive battlecard presentation
7. Sales enablement / training
8. Something else (describe it)

Your choice:
```

**Goal — "What's the outcome you want?"**

```
What outcome should this deck drive?

1. Close a deal / advance an opportunity
2. Educate / enable a team
3. Get executive buy-in
4. Win a competitive deal
5. Launch a product or campaign
6. Other (describe it)

Your choice:
```

**Audience — "Who is this for?"**

```
Who's the audience?

Provide any of the following:
• Company name or domain (e.g., acme.com)
• Person name or email (e.g., jane@acme.com)
• Role/title description (e.g., "VP Sales at mid-market SaaS")
• General audience (e.g., "internal sales team", "board of directors")

Target:
```

**Content readiness — "How much do you have already?"**

```
How much content do you have?

1. I have content ready — I'll paste or describe it
2. I have rough notes — I'll share, you help me structure
3. Help me figure it out — Octave drives the content strategy
4. I have a PPTX file — convert and enhance it

Your choice:
```

If a `.pptx` file is provided, jump to the [PPTX Conversion Path](#pptx-conversion-path) before continuing.

**Length — "How long should this be?"**

If the user provided existing content (PPTX, notes, or pasted content), offer to keep, shorten, or expand:

```
Your source has ~[N] slides worth of content. What length do you want?

1. Keep similar — stay around [N] slides
2. Shorter — condense to the essentials
3. Longer — expand with more detail and data
4. Custom — I have a specific slide count in mind

Your choice:
```

If starting from scratch, ask based on purpose:

```
How long should this deck be?

1. Short (5-8 slides) — punchy, high-impact, perfect for pitches and exec summaries
2. Medium (10-15 slides) — standard for most presentations
3. Long (18-25 slides) — detailed deep-dives, enablement, or QBRs
4. Custom — I have a specific slide count in mind

Your choice:
```

| Purpose | Recommended Default |
|---------|-------------------|
| Customer pitch / pre-demo | Short (5-8) |
| Customer QBR / review | Long (18-25) |
| Internal strategy | Medium (10-15) |
| Conference keynote | Medium (10-15) |
| Product launch / GTM | Long (18-25) |
| Competitive battlecard | Short (5-8) |
| Sales enablement | Long (18-25) |

Use the recommended default as the pre-selected option. If the user picks "Custom," ask for a target slide count.

**Density — "How should each slide read?"**

```
How dense should each slide be?

1. Speaker-led (low density) — big ideas, generous space, 1-3 bullets max,
   more slides. Best for live pitches, keynotes, exec rooms.
2. Reading-first (high density) — self-contained, structured grids,
   4-8 bullets or 4-6 cards, tighter spacing. Best for QBRs, async/leave-behind decks.

Your choice:
```

Default by purpose: pitches/keynotes/competitive → **speaker-led**; QBRs/enablement/launch/strategy → **reading-first**. Carry this choice through Step 5: it drives the content density limits per slide type (split into more slides rather than shrink text or overflow). Either way, no scrolling and no cramped text — the fixed stage scales the whole slide, it does not add room.

### Step 2: Octave-Powered Context Gathering

Based on purpose, goal, and audience, use Octave MCP tools to build rich context for the deck. **Always tell the user what you're researching and why.**

**Call as many tools as needed to build a complete picture.** The best decks come from layering multiple sources — company enrichment + Motion ICP narrative + proof points + conversation intel all combine to create slides grounded in real data. Don't stop at one tool when three would give you a stronger narrative.

That said, not every tool applies to every deck. Use your judgment about which are relevant to *this specific* situation. The tables below show what's available — pick the combination that gives you the richest context for the deck type and audience.

**List vs Search — when to use which:**

| Tool | Purpose | Use when... |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `list_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch all entities of a type (minimal fields) | You want a quick inventory — "show me all our personas" |
| `list_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch entities with full data (paginated) | You need the actual content — "get full proof point details" |
| `get_entity({ oId })` | Deep dive on one specific entity | You found something relevant and need the complete picture |
| `search_knowledge_base({ query })` | Semantic search across library + resources | You have a concept or question — "how do we compete in healthcare?" |
| `list_resources()` / `search_resources({ query })` | Uploaded docs, URLs, Google Drive files | You need reference material, uploaded assets, or source docs |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `list_*` when you know *what type* of thing you want. Use `search_*` when you know *what topic* you're looking for.

**Follow-up decks — ground them in what actually happened:**

If this deck follows a previous interaction with the account (QBR, follow-up after a demo, deal review, renewal pitch), pull findings and events to anchor the narrative in real data rather than generic positioning:

- `list_findings({ query: "<company or contact>", startDate: "<relevant period>" })` — surfaces what was actually said in calls: objections raised, features requested, pain points confirmed, competitor mentions
- `list_events({ filters: { companyDomains: ["<company_domain>"] } })` — deal stage changes, meetings held, emails sent — shows the journey so far
- `get_event_detail({ eventOId })` — deep dive on specific events (e.g., the discovery call, the demo) to pull exact context

This turns a generic "here's our product" deck into "here's what we heard from you, and here's how we're addressing it" — much more compelling for the audience.

---

Does this outline look good? I can:
1. Proceed to style selection and generation
2. Add/remove/reorder slides
3. Go deeper on any section
4. Change the narrative angle
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Brand Discovery (Optional)

This step only runs if no cached brand kit was found for the workspace company in the on-brand styling step above. Ask the user:

```
How should we style this deck?

1. Extract my brand from my website (give the URL): this becomes the deck's design system
2. I'll provide brand assets directly (colors, fonts, logo)
3. No brand, pick from style presets
4. Use Octave brand styling

Your choice:
```

> The deck wears the **workspace company's brand** (see the on-brand styling section above), so any extraction here targets the workspace company's own domain, not the target account's. A target company's logo can still appear in content (title slide, account-context slide): fetch it separately with `get_external_brand_logo` / `get_external_brand_assets`, it does not drive this extraction.

If user wants brand extraction, work down these tiers — start at Tier 1 and only fall through when a tier is unavailable. Tiers 1–2 are the fast, high-quality path; combine both when you can (colors+logo from Tier 1, fonts+components from Tier 2).

**Tier 1: Octave brand-assets tool (first-party, fast — try first)**
```
get_external_brand_assets({ url: "https://<domain>" })
  → colors (primary / secondary / accent), logo variants, backdrop images, brand name
get_external_brand_logo({ domain: "<domain>" })   # if you only need the single best logo
```
This is one call for the visual identity and the right default. **Sanity-check the result — the scraper reads the DOM and can misattribute a homepage logo wall:**
- If `brandName` doesn't match the target company, ignore it (it likely grabbed a customer name).
- A strip of many logos with varied aspect ratios is usually a **"trusted by" customer wall**, not the brand's own logo — don't use those as the deck logo. Prefer the `favicon` / `apple-touch-icon` entries or the nav wordmark.
- The `colors` are usually reliable; still confirm with the user.

**Tier 2: `scrape_website` — components & typography (the "looks like their site" leap)**
```
scrape_website({ url: "https://<domain>",        format: "html", includeScreenshot: true })
scrape_website({ url: "https://<representative-page>", format: "html", includeScreenshot: true })
```
Pull the homepage **and one representative page** (case study, blog post, pricing, or product page). Then:
- **From the screenshot(s):** read the component vocabulary the DOM hides — button shapes, card styles, corner radii, spacing rhythm, type scale, section patterns, use of gradients/imagery. Emulate this *component and layout system*, not just the colors.
- **From the html:** extract exact fonts (`font-family`, Google Fonts `<link>`s / `@font-face`), CSS custom properties (`--brand-*`, `--color-*`), and the real copy tone.

> If `scrape_website` isn't available in this workspace yet, skip to Tier 3.

**Tier 3: browser-use (fallback if `scrape_website` unavailable)**
```
1. browser-use open <website-url>
2. browser-use screenshot brand-capture.png
3. browser-use eval "(() => {
     const body = getComputedStyle(document.body);
     return {
       bgColor: body.backgroundColor, textColor: body.color, fontFamily: body.fontFamily,
       links: getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('a') || document.body).color,
       headings: getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('h1,h2,h3') || document.body).fontFamily,
       logos: [...document.querySelectorAll('header img, img[src*=logo], svg[class*=logo]')].map(e => e.src || 'inline-svg').slice(0, 3)
     };
   })()"
4. browser-use extract "List the primary brand colors (hex), fonts, and logo URLs visible on this page"
```

**Tier 4: WebFetch (fallback if browser-use unavailable)**
```
1. WebFetch the homepage URL
2. Parse HTML/CSS for CSS custom properties (--brand-*, --color-*), font-family on body/h1-h3,
   logo URLs from <img>/<svg>/og:image, and meta theme-color
```

**Tier 5: Manual (if nothing automated works)**
```
I couldn't automatically extract your brand. You can:
1. Share your brand guidelines (PDF or link)
2. Provide hex colors: primary, secondary, background, text
3. Name your fonts (heading + body)   4. Share logo files
```

**Always confirm the brand config with the user before proceeding:**

```
BRAND CONFIG EXTRACTED
======================

Colors:
  Primary:    #XXXXXX ██   Secondary: #XXXXXX ██   Accent: #XXXXXX ██
  Background: #XXXXXX ██   Text:      #XXXXXX ██

Fonts:    Headings: [Font name]    Body: [Font name]

Logo:     [URL or file path]   (verified as the brand's own, not a customer logo)

Components observed (from screenshots, if Tier 2 ran):
  • [e.g. pill buttons, 12px card radius, generous section spacing, gradient accents]

Does this look right? (y/n/adjust)
```

### Step 4: Style Selection

Ask the user how they want to choose their style:

```
How would you like to choose your style?

1. Show me options — I'll generate preview slides based on your mood
2. I know what I want — pick from 12 presets
3. Use my brand — auto-generate from brand extraction
4. Surprise me — I'll pick based on your deck purpose

Your choice:
```

---

#### Option 1: Mood-Based Previews

Ask:
```
What impression should the deck make?

1. Impressed — premium, polished, high-stakes
2. Excited — energetic, bold, forward-looking
3. Calm — clean, trustworthy, understated
4. Inspired — creative, visionary, memorable

Your mood:
```

Generate **3 single-slide HTML preview files** — show, don't tell. Each is a real, animated **title slide using the user's actual first-slide content** (title, subtitle, date, author, logo if available). Never render "Option A", "preview", a preset/template name, or any file path *on the slide itself*. Save to `.octave-decks/slide-previews/` as `style-a.html`, `style-b.html`, `style-c.html`, built on the **fixed 1920×1080 stage** (paste `viewport-base.css`).

**Preview mix:** generate previews from the mood-matched presets in [style-presets.md](../shared/style-presets.md), optionally swapping one for a custom wildcard:

| Mood | Preview presets |
|------|----------------|
| Impressed | `midnight-pro`, `executive-dark`, `octave-brand` |
| Excited | `electric-studio`, `neon-pulse`, `solar-flare` |
| Calm | `swiss-modern`, `soft-light`, `paper-minimal` |
| Inspired | `dark-botanical`, `aurora-gradient`, `monochrome-bold` |

For more range, make one of the three a **custom wildcard** — a self-generated design that follows the no-slop rules (distinctive typography, avoid Inter/Roboto/system fonts; a committed palette, no generic purple-on-white; a recognizable layout system on the fixed 16:9 stage). If brand was extracted in Step 3, add a **4th brand-themed preview**.

Open all previews in the browser for the user to compare, then ask which they prefer (or which elements to mix).

---

#### Option 2: Preset Picker

Show the preset table:

```

```

Full CSS variable definitions for each preset are in [style-presets.md](../shared/style-presets.md).

---

#### Option 3: Brand-Generated Style

Auto-generate CSS variables from the brand config extracted in Step 3:

```
- --bg: [brand background or dark variant]
- --bg-elevated: [slightly lighter than bg]
- --bg-card: [semi-transparent card bg]
- --text-primary: [brand text color]
- --text-secondary: [muted variant]
- --brand-primary: [primary brand color]
- --brand-500: [lighter accent]
- --font-display: [brand heading font]
- --font-body: [brand body font]
```

Show the generated style to the user for confirmation.

### Step 5: Generate Presentation

Build a single, self-contained HTML file. **No external dependencies.** Everything inlined.

#### Output Directory

Every deck gets its own folder under `.octave-decks/`:

```
.octave-decks/
├── slide-previews/                    # temp style previews (cleaned up after selection)
└── <kebab-case-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/   # one folder per deck
    ├── <name>.html                    # final HTML presentation
    ├── <name>.pptx                    # PPTX export (if requested)
    ├── <name>-carousel.html           # LinkedIn carousel version (if requested)
    ├── <name>-content.md              # markdown export (if requested)
    └── assets/                        # images (from PPTX conversion or user-provided)
```

Example: `/octave:deck "pitch for Acme Corp"` → `.octave-decks/acme-corp-pitch-2026-02-07/acme-corp-pitch.html`

The entire `.octave-decks/` directory is in `.gitignore` — nothing here gets committed.

#### HTML Architecture

See [html-scaffold.md](references/html-scaffold.md) for the full scaffold. **Two non-negotiables:**

1. **Paste the entire [viewport-base.css](references/viewport-base.css)** into the `<style>` block. It provides the `.deck-viewport` → `.deck-stage` (1920×1080) → `.slide` system, `.active`/`.visible` visibility, print-one-slide-per-page, and reduced-motion.
2. **Author every slide at 1920×1080 in px** — no `clamp()`, `vw`, or `vh` for layout. The stage scales as a whole to fit any screen.

#### Fixed-Canvas Fitting (Critical)

Every slide is a fixed 1920×1080 canvas; the controller scales the whole stage. Fit is achieved by **density discipline**, not responsive math:

1. **Size in px against the 1920×1080 canvas.** A title is ~96–120px, body ~24–32px, slide padding ~80×140px. Translate any `clamp()`/`vw` from a preset or custom design into fixed px.
2. **`overflow: hidden` on every `.slide`** (from viewport-base.css) — anything that doesn't fit is clipped, so it must fit by design.
3. **Content density limits per slide type** (tighten for *speaker-led*, allow the upper bound for *reading-first* — see Step 1 density choice):

**Numeric interpretation rule:** Every displayed number must state its unit in the same visual block, with the reporting period and scope nearby. If categories overlap, say so. If evidence was deduplicated, name the deduplication unit. Reader-facing slides use plain units such as calls, companies, deals, or buyer quotes. Never expose internal evidence mechanics through labels such as “receipt set.”

| Slide Type | Max Content |
|-----------|------------|
| Title | 1 heading + 1 subtitle (2-3 lines max) |
| Section Divider | 1 big heading + 1 subtitle. Chapter break. |
| Content | 1 heading + 4-6 bullet points |
| Grid/Cards | 1 heading + 6 cards maximum |
| Quote | 1 quote (3 lines max) + attribution |
| Metric | 1 heading + 3-4 big numbers |
| Comparison | 1 heading + 2-column layout (6 rows max) |
| Timeline/Process | 1 heading + 4-6 steps (label + short description each) |
| Logo Wall | 1 heading + 8-12 logos in a grid |
| Image | 1 heading + 1 image + 1 caption |
| Agenda/TOC | 1 heading + 5-8 agenda items |
| CTA/Closing | 1 heading + 1-2 lines + 1 action |

4. **If content exceeds limits — split into more slides.** Never shrink text below readable size and never overflow.
5. **Verify before delivery.** If browser-use is available, open the deck and screenshot a few slides to check for clipped text or overlapping panels (a card can pass a height check while still being covered by another grid panel). Fix by splitting or reducing content.

#### Animation Patterns

Reveals are triggered by the `.visible` class the controller toggles on the active slide (no Intersection Observer — slides switch via `.active`/`.visible`, not scroll):

```css
.animate-in {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(30px);
  transition: opacity 0.6s var(--ease), transform 0.6s var(--ease);
}
.slide.visible .animate-in { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
/* Stagger children */
.slide.visible .animate-in:nth-child(1) { transition-delay: 0.1s; }
.slide.visible .animate-in:nth-child(2) { transition-delay: 0.2s; }
.slide.visible .animate-in:nth-child(3) { transition-delay: 0.3s; }
/* ... up to 8 */
```

Match motion to the chosen style (see [references/animation-patterns.md](references/animation-patterns.md) for the effect-to-feeling guide and snippets: fade/slide, scale-in, blur-in, gradient-mesh backgrounds, 3D tilt). Use extras sparingly: counter animations for metrics, draw-in for borders, fade-scale for cards. `prefers-reduced-motion` is already handled by viewport-base.css.

#### Navigation Implementation

A small `SlidePresentation` controller (in the scaffold) handles everything — **no scroll-snap, no nav dots**:

```javascript
// 1. Stage scaling: transform = translate(x,y) scale(min(vw/1920, vh/1080)); re-fit on resize
// 2. show(i): toggle .active + .visible on the target slide (re-runs .animate-in reveals)
// 3. Keyboard: ArrowRight/PageDown/Space = next; ArrowLeft/PageUp = prev; Home/End; R = reset
// 4. Touch: swipe left/right
// 5. #deckControls (outside the stage, so it isn't scaled): "n / total" + prev/next buttons
```

#### Avoid AI Slop

Whether using a preset or a custom wildcard, the output should look intentional, not generated:

- **Fonts:** avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, and raw system fonts for *custom* looks. Reach for distinctive display faces (Fontshare/Google Fonts). (Brand presets that specify a brand font are fine.)
- **Color:** commit to a palette with a sharp accent — avoid generic purple-gradient-on-white and timid washes.
- **Layout:** vary slide types; avoid cookie-cutter "title + 3 bullets" on every slide.
- **Context:** the design should fit the occasion and audience (a board deck and a hackathon demo should not look alike).

#### Inline Editing (included by default)

Add a lightweight in-browser editor so the user can tweak copy without touching code. Do **not** ask about it during intake — include it unless the user requested a locked/export-only deck. Implementation details (the JS-based hover with a 400ms grace period — **not** a CSS `~` sibling selector, which breaks because `pointer-events:none` drops the hover chain — plus the `E` shortcut and stripping edit state on export) are in [html-scaffold.md](references/html-scaffold.md).

#### Slide Type Templates

Consult [references/slide-templates.md](references/slide-templates.md) for HTML templates for each slide type: title, content, grid/card, metric, quote, comparison, section divider, timeline, logo wall, image, agenda, and CTA. Mix types for visual variety.

### Step 5b: Review Loop — MANDATORY GATE

After generating, run up to 3 review passes against every principles checklist, per the [review protocol](../shared/protocol.md). This is a mandatory gate: do not ask the user whether to review, announce that it's happening, and do not open or deliver the deck until a pass comes back clean and the scorecard has printed. The mechanical preflight (em dashes, broken images/logos, unsafe links, unthemed scrollbars, leaked internals) always runs first.

**Pass structure:** Each pass audits the generated HTML against all four principles documents in order:

1. [Editorial rules](../shared/editorial-rules.md) — run the full Review Checklist (Pass 1: Mechanical, Pass 2: Structure Scan, Pass 3: Quality)
2. [Presentation principles](../shared/presentation-principles.md) — run the full Review Checklist
3. [Slide deck format](../shared/formats/slide-deck.md) — run the full Review Checklist
4. [Information principles](../shared/information-principles.md) — run the full Review Checklist

**Per pass:**
- Read the generated HTML file
- Audit against each checklist item. Be specific: cite the slide number, the text, and the rule violated.
- If violations are found, fix them in the HTML and note what changed
- If no violations are found, the pass is clean

**Loop logic:**
- **Pass 1:** Always runs. If violations found, fix and continue to Pass 2.
- **Pass 2:** Re-audit the fixed output. If violations found, fix and continue to Pass 3.
- **Pass 3:** Final audit. If violations remain, fix them. Do not loop further.
- **If a pass is clean:** Stop. The output is ready for delivery.

Report the results to the user concisely: which pass caught what, what was fixed, and confirm the final state is clean. Then proceed to Step 6.

### Step 6: Delivery

After the review loop passes clean:

1. **Clean up** any preview files from `.octave-decks/slide-previews/`
2. **Open the presentation** in the default browser
3. **Present a summary:**

```
PRESENTATION READY
==================

Folder: .octave-decks/<deck-name>-<date>/
File:   .octave-decks/<deck-name>-<date>/<deck-name>.html
Slides: [N] slides
Style:  [Preset name or "Custom Brand"]
Size:   [file size]

Navigation:
• Arrow keys / Space / Page Up-Down to move; Home/End to jump; R to reset
• Swipe left/right on touch devices
• Prev/next + "n / total" controls at the bottom
• Scales to fit any screen (fixed 16:9 stage, letterboxed)

Editing:
• Hover the top-left corner (or press E) to toggle inline edit mode, then
  click any text to edit. Export saves a clean copy with edit state stripped.

Customization tips:
• Colors/fonts: edit the :root CSS variables at the top of the file
• Content: each <section class="slide"> inside .deck-stage is one slide
• Add slides: copy a <section class="slide"> block (only the first carries
  "active visible")

Want me to:
1. Adjust specific slides
2. Change the style/colors
3. Add or remove slides
4. Create a version for a different audience
5. Export or share (PDF, live URL/Vercel, LinkedIn Carousel, PPTX, Google Slides, Gamma)
6. Done
```

### Step 7: Export & Share (Optional)

Consult [references/export-guide.md](references/export-guide.md) for detailed instructions per format:

- **PDF** — `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}"/scripts/export-pdf.sh <deck>.html` (headless Playwright, one slide/page; `--compact` for smaller files). Browser print is the fallback.
- **Live URL** — `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}"/scripts/deploy.sh <deck-folder>/` deploys to Vercel and returns a public link that works on any device.
- **LinkedIn Carousel, PPTX, Google Slides, Gamma, Markdown** — as documented in the export guide.

> `export-pdf.sh` and `deploy.sh` are generic — the same commands work for any HTML output from the other Octave skills (one-pager, proposal, microsite, brief, win-loss-report).

## PPTX Conversion Path

When a `.pptx` file is provided:

### Extract Content

```python
# Install if needed: pip install python-pptx Pillow
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt
import json, os

prs = Presentation("input.pptx")
slides = []
deck_dir = ".octave-decks/<deck-name>-<date>"
os.makedirs(f"{deck_dir}/assets", exist_ok=True)

for i, slide in enumerate(prs.slides):
    slide_data = {"index": i, "shapes": []}
    for shape in slide.shapes:
        if shape.has_text_frame:
            slide_data["shapes"].append({
                "type": "text",
                "text": shape.text_frame.text,
                "paragraphs": [
                    {"text": p.text, "level": p.level}
                    for p in shape.text_frame.paragraphs
                ]
            })
        elif shape.shape_type == 13:  # Picture
            img = shape.image
            ext = img.content_type.split("/")[-1]
            fname = f"{deck_dir}/assets/slide{i}_img{len(slide_data['shapes'])}.{ext}"
            with open(fname, "wb") as f:
                f.write(img.blob)
            slide_data["shapes"].append({"type": "image", "path": fname})
    slides.append(slide_data)
```

### Conversion Flow

1. Extract text and images from PPTX using python-pptx
2. Save images to the `assets/` subdirectory inside the deck folder (`.octave-decks/<deck-name>-<date>/assets/`)
3. Show extracted content structure to the user for review
4. **Still run Step 1** (purpose/goal) — the content comes from the PPTX but context matters
5. **Still offer Step 3** (brand) — the original PPTX style is lost in conversion
6. Proceed to Steps 4-6 as normal, using extracted content instead of Octave-generated content

> **Note:** Images from the PPTX are saved as separate files referenced by the HTML. The output is still a single HTML file, but images are external assets. Mention this to the user.

>
> To reconnect: check your Octave MCP configuration and reconnect

**Company/Person Not Found:**
> I couldn't find detailed intelligence for [target].
>
> Options:
> 1. Proceed with what we have — I'll use general positioning from your library
> 2. Try a different domain or email
> 3. Provide the content manually and I'll build the deck
