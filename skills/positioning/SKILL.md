# /octave:positioning - Visual Messaging & Positioning System

Generate a complete, visual Messaging & Positioning system rendered as a single stunning HTML document. Eight interconnected frameworks — from the foundational Message Framework through Positioning Anchors, Strategy Table, Persona Messaging, Awareness Funnel, Use Case Canvas, Lifecycle Mapping, and Homepage Messaging — all pulled from your Octave library and grounded in real conversation evidence.

Unlike `/octave:messaging` which outputs text-based frameworks, this skill renders the full positioning system as a polished, scrollable HTML document with visual grids, color-coded persona columns, funnel diagrams, timelines, and split-view canvases. Designed to be the single source of truth for your product's positioning — bookmarkable, printable, and shareable.

**Key differentiators:**
- vs `/octave:messaging` — messaging outputs text; positioning renders it as a visual HTML system
- vs `/octave:deck` — deck is a presentation for an audience; positioning is a reference document
- vs `/octave:brief` — brief is account-specific; positioning is about YOUR product/company

## On-brand styling — use a brand kit if one exists

Before generating, decide whose brand this positioning doc should match (usually the **target company**; sometimes your own company). Then:

1. Resolve the company to a `<slug>` and check for a cached brand kit at `~/.octave/brands/<slug>/manifest.json`.
2. **If a kit exists →** offer it: *"I found a saved brand kit for <Company> — want this positioning doc rendered in their brand?"* If yes, style the output with the kit instead of a generic preset:
   - inline the kit's `tokens.css` (`:root` + the embedded `@font-face`) **and** `get-brand-components/assets/kit_base.css` into the output `<style>`;
   - follow `brand-kit.md` → **Signature moves**, and reuse the kit's real **logo**, `images/`, and `icons.json`;
   - for doc-shaped output you can compose directly with `get-brand-components/scripts/render_kit.py` (hero / split / logos / pricing / cta / footer blocks).
3. **If no kit exists →** offer to build one first: *"No brand kit for <Company> yet — want me to capture it (~1 min) so this is on-brand?"* → run `/octave:get-brand-components <domain>`, then proceed.
4. **If the user declines →** generate with the default style/preset.

> The brand kit is the strongest styling signal — when one is available, prefer it over generic `--style` presets. See the `get-brand-components` skill for the kit format, token contract, and renderer.

## Optional review pass

After generating the asset, **offer** an optional review (don't force it): *"Want me to run a quick review pass over this — layout, brand, narrative, groundedness, and AI-slop?"* If yes, follow [`get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md`](../get-brand-components/references/asset-review.md): render/screenshot the output, inspect it across the five dimensions (render the pixels and actually look — overflow and white-on-white only show in the render), report a short scorecard of specific located findings, then fix and re-verify. Skip silently if the user declines.

/octave:positioning awareness --style paper-minimal           # Awareness funnel with light style
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:positioning`:

### Step 1: Understand the Context

**Determine scope:**

If no section specified, confirm full exercise:

```
I'll generate a complete Messaging & Positioning system — all 8 frameworks
in one visual HTML document.

THE 8 FRAMEWORKS
1. Message Framework     — 3-layer pyramid: market → product → value props by persona
2. Positioning Anchors   — Primary & secondary positioning statements
3. Positioning Strategy  — Tactical table: buyer, use case, problems, differentiators
4. Persona Messaging     — Core message translated per buying committee role
5. Awareness Funnel      — Value props adapted by buyer awareness stage
6. Use Case Canvas       — Current Way vs New Way per use case
7. Use Case Lifecycle    — Customer journey phases with touchpoints & messaging
8. Homepage Messaging    — Website implementation: primary vs secondary messaging

PRODUCT FOCUS
Which product should this positioning system cover?

1. [Product 1 from library]
2. [Product 2 from library]
3. Entire company / all products
4. Specific use case or segment

Your choice:
```

If a specific section was requested, confirm and proceed directly.

### Step 2: Octave Context Gathering

Gather all library intelligence in a single pass. **Tell the user what you're researching and why.** All 8 sections share the same data pool — gather once, render many.

**Call as many tools as needed to build a complete picture.** The best positioning systems come from layering multiple sources — product details + persona definitions + Motion ICP cell narratives + competitive context + proof points + conversation evidence all combine to create frameworks grounded in real data.

**List vs Search — when to use which:**

| Tool | Purpose | Use when... |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `list_all_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch all entities of a type (minimal fields) | You want a quick inventory — "show me all personas" |
| `list_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch entities with full data (paginated) | You need the actual content — "get full persona details" |
| `get_entity({ oId })` | Deep dive on one specific entity | You found something relevant and need the complete picture |
| `search_knowledge_base({ query })` | Semantic search across library + resources | You have a concept — "how do we position for enterprise?" |
| `list_resources()` / `search_resources({ query })` | Uploaded docs, URLs, Google Drive files | You need reference material or source docs |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `list_*` when you know *what type* of thing you want. Use `search_*` when you know *what topic* you're looking for.

---

#### Data Gathering Matrix

Every section needs data from the library. Gather it all up front:

| What you need | Tool | Sections that use it |
|---------------|------|---------------------|
| All products | `list_all_entities({ entityType: "product" })` | All 8 |
| Product deep dive | `get_entity({ oId: "<product_oId>" })` | All 8 |
| All personas | `list_entities({ entityType: "persona" })` | 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 |
| All segments | `list_entities({ entityType: "segment" })` | 1, 3 |
| All use cases | `list_entities({ entityType: "use_case" })` | 1, 3, 6, 7 |
| All competitors | `list_all_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })` | 2, 3, 6 |
| Competitor details | `get_entity({ oId })` | 3, 6 |
| All Motions | `list_motions()` | 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 |
| Motion Playbooks under a Motion | `list_motion_playbooks({ motionOId })` | 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 |
| Full Motion Playbook | `get_motion_playbook({ motionPlaybookOId })` | 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 |
| Persona × segment matrix | `list_motion_icps({ motionOId })` | 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 |
| Motion ICP cell narrative | `find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId, includeLearnings: true })` | 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 |
| Proof points | `list_entities({ entityType: "proof_point" })` | 2, 3, 5 |
| References | `list_entities({ entityType: "reference" })` | 2, 3 |
| Brand voice | `list_all_entities(entityType: "brand_voice")` | 8 (homepage tone) |
| Competitive positioning | `search_knowledge_base({ query: "<product> differentiation competitive advantage", entityTypes: ["competitor"] })` | 2, 3, 6 |
| What resonates | `list_findings({ query: "value propositions positive reactions resonated", startDate: "<90 days ago>", eventFilters: { sentiments: ["POSITIVE"] } })` | 2, 5 |
| What falls flat | `list_findings({ query: "objections pushback concerns", startDate: "<90 days ago>", eventFilters: { sentiments: ["NEGATIVE"] } })` | 3, 5 |

Does this look right? I can:
1. Proceed to style selection and generation
2. Add or remove sections
3. Go deeper on any data area
4. Change the product focus
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Style Selection

The positioning system uses the same CSS variable / style preset system as `/octave:deck`. Full preset definitions are in the deck skill's [style-presets.md](../deck/references/style-presets.md).

Positioning documents default to strategic, executive-friendly presets. If `--style` was not provided, ask:

```
Pick a style for your positioning system:

DARK (recommended for strategy documents)
  1. midnight-pro      — Dark navy + blue accents. Executive feel. [DEFAULT]
  2. executive-dark    — Charcoal + gold. Premium boardroom.
  3. octave-brand      — Purple on navy. Product-aligned.

LIGHT
  4. paper-minimal     — Off-white + black type. Editorial.
  5. swiss-modern      — White + red accent. Clean minimal.
  6. soft-light        — Warm white + sage green. Calm.

VIBRANT
  7. solar-flare       — Deep orange gradients. Bold.
  8. aurora-gradient   — Purple-to-teal. Visionary.

OTHER
  9. Use my brand      — Extract from website or provide colors
  10. Match an existing doc — Reuse style from a previous /octave: document

Your choice (number or name, or press Enter for midnight-pro):
```

If the user selects "Use my brand," follow the brand discovery flow from the deck skill (website extraction via browser-use or WebFetch, manual fallback). If they select "Match an existing doc," ask for the file path and extract its CSS variables.

### Step 4: Generate HTML

Build a single self-contained HTML file. **No external dependencies except Google Fonts.** Everything else inlined.

#### Output Directory

```
.octave-positioning/
└── <product-kebab>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
    └── positioning-system.html
```

Example: `/octave:positioning --product "Octave"` produces `.octave-positioning/octave-2026-02-24/positioning-system.html`

For single sections: `.octave-positioning/octave-message-framework-2026-02-24/message-framework.html`

The `.octave-positioning/` directory should be in `.gitignore`.

#### HTML Architecture

The positioning system is a scrollable reference document — not a slide deck. Natural page scroll, sticky sidebar navigation, collapsible sections, and a print-friendly layout.

The full HTML structure, section templates, and CSS component patterns are defined in the references:
- [section-templates.md](references/section-templates.md) — HTML templates for all 8 section types
- [section-layouts.md](references/section-layouts.md) — Section-specific CSS patterns (grids, funnels, timelines, canvases)

See [html-scaffold.md](references/html-scaffold.md) for the full HTML + CSS scaffold of the positioning system document, including persona color system, highlight classes, and key differences from other doc skills.

#### Content Population

Populate each section using the templates in [section-templates.md](references/section-templates.md). Each section has:
- A **section number** and **title** in the summary
- A **subtitle** explaining what this framework answers
- The **visual layout** appropriate to that framework type
- **Real data** from the Octave context gathered in Step 2

For each section, use `generate_content` to synthesize the gathered library data into the framework structure:

```
generate_content({
  instructions: "Generate content for the [Section Name] framework.
    Structure: [specific structure for this section — see section-templates.md]
    Ground everything in the library data provided. Do not invent data.",
  customContext: "<relevant subset of gathered library intelligence>"
})
```

Then render the generated content into the HTML template for that section.

#### Content Density Guidelines

Each section has specific content limits to keep the document scannable:

| Section | Content Limit |
|---------|--------------|
| Message Framework | 3 layers, up to 8 value prop rows (one per persona-use case combination) |
| Positioning Anchors | 1 primary anchor + 3-5 secondary anchors + 2-3 combination examples |
| Positioning Strategy | 1 summary row + up to 6 comparison rows (competitive alternatives) |
| Persona Messaging | Up to 5 persona columns (User, Champion, Decision Maker, Financial Buyer, Technical Influencer) |
| Awareness Funnel | 4 fixed columns × 3 rows (Lead with, Earn trust by, To convince them) |
| Use Case Canvas | 1 canvas per use case, up to 3 use cases |
| Use Case Lifecycle | 6-8 journey phases per use case |
| Homepage Messaging | 1 primary column + 1 secondary column with up to 5 expansion rows |

### Step 5: Delivery

After generating the HTML file:

1. **Open the document** in the default browser
2. **Present a summary:**

```
POSITIONING SYSTEM READY
=========================

Folder: .octave-positioning/<product>-<date>/
File:   .octave-positioning/<product>-<date>/positioning-system.html
Style:  [Preset name]

Product: [Product name]
Sections: [N] frameworks generated
Data sources: [N] personas, [N] use cases, [N] value props, [N] proof points

Navigation:
- Scroll through all 8 frameworks
- Sidebar dots on the right track your position
- Click section headers to collapse/expand
- PDF (recommended): bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}"/scripts/export-pdf.sh .octave-positioning/<product>-<date>/positioning-system.html  — or Cmd+P / Ctrl+P -> Save as PDF

---

Want me to:
1. Adjust or expand a section
2. Go deeper on a specific framework
3. Generate campaign content from this positioning (/octave:campaign)
4. Create a sales deck from this (/octave:deck)
5. Save positioning statements back to library
6. Change the style
7. Export as PDF (print dialog)
8. Done
```

**If the user wants to save back to library:**

```
# Save positioning statements to product entity
update_entity({
  entityType: "product",
  oId: "<product_oId>",
  instructions: "Update positioning to: [primary positioning anchor]. Category: [category]. Primary value prop: [primary VP]."
})

# Fold the positioning system into Motion Playbook narrative sections (Strategic narrative,
# Benefits and impacts, Pains and consequences) for the Motion ICP cells in scope.
# A positioning exercise typically updates the Default Motion Playbook of the offering's Motion,
# touching every persona × segment cell to reflect the new anchors and persona messaging.
update_motion_playbook({
  motionPlaybookOId: "<motion_playbook_oId>",
  instructions: "Update Strategic narrative and Benefits and impacts across all Motion ICP cells to reflect: primary anchor = [...], persona-specific messages = [...]."
})
```

## MCP Tools Used

## Error Handling

**No Products Found:**
> No products in your library.
>
> The positioning system needs at least one product to build frameworks around.
> Run `/octave:library create product` first, or describe your product and I'll work from that.

**No Personas Found:**
> No personas defined yet.
>
> I can generate a basic positioning system, but persona-specific sections (Message Framework value props, Persona Messaging, Homepage expansion) will be limited.
> Run `/octave:library create persona` to add personas.

**No Use Cases Found:**
> No use cases defined.
>
> Sections 6 (Use Case Canvas) and 7 (Use Case Lifecycle) require use cases. I'll skip them and generate the other 6 sections.
> Run `/octave:library create use_case` to add use cases.

**No Motions or Motion ICP Cells:**
> No Motions or Motion ICP cells found.
>
> The Message Framework and Persona Messaging sections will use product-level information only. For richer output, create a Motion in the Motion builder (which auto-generates a Default Motion Playbook covering the persona × segment matrix), then re-run this skill.

**No Competitors Found:**
> No competitors in your library.
>
> Sections 3 (Positioning Strategy) and 6 (Use Case Canvas) will omit competitive comparisons. The other sections will generate from product and persona data.
> Run `/octave:library create competitor` to add competitors.

**No Conversation Evidence:**
> No conversation findings available.
>
> The positioning system will be built entirely from library data. As your team logs calls, re-running this skill will surface what resonates and what doesn't — making each iteration sharper.

**Octave Connection Failed:**
> Could not connect to your Octave workspace.
>
> The positioning system builder needs Octave data to generate useful frameworks. Without it, most sections would be empty.
> To reconnect: check your MCP configuration or run `/octave:workspace status`
