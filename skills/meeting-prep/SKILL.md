# /octave:meeting-prep - Strategic Meeting Battle Plan

Build a coached, strategic meeting battle plan rendered as a self-contained HTML document. Unlike `/octave:brief` (a reference dossier), this skill produces a battle plan — combining Octave intelligence with coaching frameworks to generate belief stacks, scripted talk tracks, discovery questions, a stakeholder map, landmine warnings, and a phase-by-phase game plan timed to your meeting duration.

The skill reads two coaching reference files at runtime:
- `references/strategic-coach.md` — Enterprise strategic sales coaching (belief stacking, ecosystem positioning, Socratic discovery)
- `references/positioning-coach.md` — Product positioning coaching based on April Dunford's methodology (positioned sales pitch, competitive alternatives, feature-value-emotion ladder)

If a user replaces these files with their own coaching frameworks, the skill adapts automatically.

**Key differentiators:**
- vs `/octave:brief` — brief is a reference dossier; meeting-prep is a coached battle plan with talk tracks and a timed game plan
- vs `/octave:research` — research outputs plain text; meeting-prep renders a styled HTML document with coaching intelligence
- vs `/octave:deck` — deck is a slide presentation for the audience; meeting-prep is internal prep for the seller

## Usage

```
/octave:meeting-prep <target> [--type <meeting-type>] [--style <preset>]
```

## Meeting Types

| Type | Primary Focus |
|------|--------------|
| `discovery` | Discovery questions primary, belief framework, qualification |
| `demo` | Positioned pitch tailored to demo flow, demo landmines |
| `follow-up` | Updated pain from prior calls, deal advancement |
| `executive` | Concise TL;DR, executive talk tracks, board-level framing |
| `qbr` | Value delivered, renewal/expansion angles |
| `general` | Balanced all sections (default) |

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:meeting-prep`:

### Step 1: Understand the Context

**1.1 Identify the target:**
- Email address -> Person-targeted prep (enrich person + company)
- Domain -> Company-targeted prep (enrich company + find key contacts)
- LinkedIn URL -> Person-targeted prep
- Meeting description -> Extract company/people from context

**1.2 Detect or ask meeting type:**

If `--type` not specified, infer from context or ask:

```
What type of meeting are you prepping for?

1. Discovery — First conversation, qualifying the opportunity
2. Demo — Showing the product, proving value
3. Follow-up — Continuing a conversation, advancing the deal
4. Executive — High-level strategic conversation
5. QBR — Quarterly business review with existing customer
6. General — Balanced battle plan (default)

Your choice:
```

**1.3 Ask meeting duration:**

The duration drives the game plan timeline — phases get proportional time allocations.

```
How long is this meeting?

1. 30 minutes
2. 45 minutes
3. 60 minutes
4. 90 minutes

Your choice:
```

**1.4 Collect user context:**

Ask if the user has any prior context to incorporate:

```
Do you have any prior context to fold in?

1. Call transcript or recording notes
2. Email thread or meeting notes
3. My own notes / talking points
4. No prior context — use Octave intel + coaching frameworks

Paste or describe (or press Enter to skip):
```

If the user provides a transcript, notes, or email thread, synthesize that context alongside Octave data. If they skip, proceed with Octave intel and coaching frameworks only.

**1.5 Identify attendees:**

```
Who's attending? (names, titles, emails — or "I don't know yet")
```

If attendees are unknown, build a general stakeholder map from Octave contacts.

**1.6 Read coaching reference files:**

Read the two coaching reference files from the skill directory:
- `references/strategic-coach.md` — Extract: belief stacking, ecosystem positioning, enhancement framing, ideal customer fit, guardrail reframe, Socratic discovery
- `references/positioning-coach.md` — Extract: positioned sales pitch (5 steps), feature→value→emotion, competitive alternatives, category framing, language mining, heads on pillows test

If the files are not found, fall back to general sales coaching best practices.

### Step 2: Octave Context Gathering

Based on the target and meeting type, use Octave MCP tools to build a complete intelligence picture. **Tell the user what you're researching and why.**

**Call as many tools as needed to build a thorough battle plan.** The best meeting preps layer multiple sources — company enrichment + person enrichment + Motion ICP cell narrative + proof points + conversation intel + coaching frameworks all combine to create a document grounded in real data. Don't stop at one tool when several would give you a stronger prep.

Not every tool applies to every meeting. Use your judgment about which are relevant to *this specific* situation. The tables below show what's available — pick the combination that gives you the richest context for the meeting type and target.

**List vs Search — when to use which:**

| Tool | Purpose | Use when... |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `list_all_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch all entities of a type (minimal fields) | You want a quick inventory — "show me all our competitors" |
| `list_entities({ entityType })` | Fetch entities with full data (paginated) | You need the actual content — "get full proof point details" |
| `get_entity({ oId })` | Deep dive on one specific entity | You found something relevant and need the complete picture |
| `search_knowledge_base({ query })` | Semantic search across library + resources | You have a concept or question — "how do we position for healthcare?" |
| `list_resources()` / `search_resources({ query })` | Uploaded docs, URLs, Google Drive files | You need reference material, uploaded assets, or source docs |

**Rule of thumb:** Use `list_*` when you know *what type* of thing you want. Use `search_*` when you know *what topic* you're looking for.

**Findings and events — always attempt, gracefully skip:**

ALWAYS try to pull findings and events if you have a company domain or contact emails. Use a 90-day window. If data exists, it populates the "Prior Intelligence" section. If not, silently omit — no error message.

- `list_findings({ query: "<company or contact>", startDate: "<90 days ago>" })` — surfaces what was actually said in calls: objections raised, features requested, pain points confirmed, competitor mentions
- `list_events({ filters: { accounts: ["<account_oId>"] } })` — deal stage changes, meetings held, emails sent
- `get_event_detail({ eventOId })` — deep dive on specific past interactions

---

#### For Person-Targeted Preps

Start with person and company enrichment, then pull positioning context:

| What you need | Tool | When to use |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| Person deep-dive | `enrich_person({ person: { email, firstName, lastName, companyDomain } })` | Always for person-targeted preps — gives background, role, priorities |
| Company profile | `enrich_company({ companyDomain })` | Always — gives industry, size, tech stack, signals |
| ICP fit (person) | `qualify_person({ person: { ... } })` | When you need persona match and fit assessment |
| ICP fit (company) | `qualify_company({ companyDomain })` | When you need segment match and ICP scoring |
| Additional contacts | `find_person({ searchMode: "people", companyDomain, fuzzyTitles })` | When you want to map the broader buying committee |
| Motions for the offering | `list_motions()` | Always — find the Motion(s) covering this offering / motion type |
| Persona × segment matrix | `list_motion_icps({ motionOId })` | See which Motion ICP cells exist; pick the one matching this person/company |
| Motion ICP cell narrative | `find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId, includeLearnings: true })` | Full cell narrative (Target ICP overview, Operating landscape, Strategic narrative, Pains and consequences, Benefits and impacts, Methodology, References) + Learning Loop learnings |
| Custom Motion Playbook | `list_motion_playbooks({ motionOId })` + `get_motion_playbook` | Pull Thematic / Milestone / Account / Competitive angles layered on the Motion |
| Proof points | `list_entities({ entityType: "proof_point" })` | Fetch all proof points with full data — metrics, quotes, logos |
| References | `list_entities({ entityType: "reference" })` | Customer references with full details |
| Competitive context | `search_knowledge_base({ query: "<signals>", entityTypes: ["competitor"] })` | When competitor is mentioned or likely in the deal |
| Recent intel | `list_findings({ query: "<company or person>", startDate: "<90 days ago>" })` | Conversation-based insights from past interactions |
| Deal history | `list_events({ filters: { accounts: ["<account_oId>"] } })` | Timeline of deal events |
| Synthesized prep | `generate_call_prep({ companyDomain })` | Quick comprehensive brief to use as a starting point |

---

#### For Company-Targeted Preps

Start with company enrichment and contact discovery:

| What you need | Tool | When to use |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| Company profile | `enrich_company({ companyDomain })` | Always — gives industry, size, tech stack, funding, signals |
| ICP fit scoring | `qualify_company({ companyDomain })` | Always — segment match, fit score, fit reasons |
| Key contacts | `find_person({ searchMode: "people", companyDomain, fuzzyTitles })` | Find stakeholders to populate the Stakeholder Map |
| Enrich contacts | `enrich_person({ person: { ... } })` | Deep dive on each key contact found |
| All Motions | `list_motions()` | Quick scan to find the right Motion(s) for this offering |
| Motion Playbooks | `list_motion_playbooks({ motionOId })` | Default + Custom Motion Playbooks under the Motion |
| Motion ICP matrix | `list_motion_icps({ motionOId })` | The persona × segment grid — pick the cells that match this account's buying committee |
| Motion ICP cell narrative | `find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId, includeLearnings: true })` | Full per-cell narrative + Learning Loop learnings |
| All competitors | `list_all_entities({ entityType: "competitor" })` | Quick scan of competitive landscape |
| Competitor details | `get_entity({ oId })` | Deep dive on a specific relevant competitor |
| Proof points | `list_entities({ entityType: "proof_point" })` | Full proof points for the evidence section |
| References | `list_entities({ entityType: "reference" })` | Customer references for social proof |
| Topic search | `search_knowledge_base({ query: "<industry> <use case>", entityTypes: ["proof_point", "reference"] })` | Find proof points relevant to their specific situation |
| Recent intel | `list_findings({ query: "<company>", startDate: "<90 days ago>" })` | Conversation signals from calls and meetings |
| Deal events | `list_events({ filters: { accounts: ["<account_oId>"] } })` | Full deal history and timeline |
| Event details | `get_event_detail({ eventOId })` | Deep dive on specific past interactions |

---

Does this look good? I can:
1. Proceed to style selection and generation
2. Add or remove sections
3. Go deeper on any area
4. Change the meeting type or emphasis
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Style Selection

The battle plan uses the same CSS variable / style preset system as `/octave:deck`. Full preset definitions are in the deck skill's [style-presets.md](../deck/references/style-presets.md).

Battle plans default to readability-optimized presets. If `--style` was not provided, ask:

```
Pick a style for your battle plan:

1. midnight-pro     — Dark navy, white text, blue accents (default)
2. paper-minimal    — Off-white, black type, editorial simplicity
3. executive-dark   — Charcoal + gold, premium boardroom aesthetic
4. soft-light       — Warm white + sage green, calm and approachable
5. swiss-modern     — White + red accent, Bauhaus minimal
6. Use my brand     — Extract from website or provide colors
7. Match my deck    — Use the same style as an existing /octave:deck

Your choice (or press Enter for default):
```

| Meeting Type | Recommended Default |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Discovery | `midnight-pro` |
| Demo | `midnight-pro` |
| Follow-up | `midnight-pro` |
| Executive | `executive-dark` |
| QBR | `executive-dark` |
| General | `midnight-pro` |

If the user selects "Use my brand," follow the brand discovery flow from the deck skill (website extraction via browser-use or WebFetch, manual fallback). If they select "Match my deck," ask for the deck file path and extract its CSS variables.

### Step 4: Generate HTML

Build a single self-contained HTML file. The battle plan is a scrollable reference document — not a slide deck. Natural page scroll, sticky sidebar navigation, collapsible sections, and a print-friendly layout.

#### Output Directory

```
.octave-meeting-prep/
└── <kebab-case-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
    └── <name>.html
```

Example: `/octave:meeting-prep acme.com --type discovery` -> `.octave-meeting-prep/acme-discovery-2026-02-27/acme-discovery.html`

The `.octave-meeting-prep/` directory should be in `.gitignore`.

#### Meeting Type → Section Emphasis

Not all sections are equally weighted in every meeting type. The type determines emphasis:

| Meeting Type | Emphasized Sections | De-emphasized / Condensed |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Discovery | Their Pain, What They Need to Believe, Discovery Questions, Coach's Corner | Positioned Sales Pitch (lighter), Deal Intelligence |
| Demo | Positioned Sales Pitch, Stakeholder Map, Landmines & Watch-Outs | Discovery Questions (lighter), Deal Intelligence |
| Follow-up | Their Pain (updated), Deal Intelligence, Meeting Game Plan, Landmines | Stakeholder Map (condensed) |
| Executive | TL;DR, Positioned Sales Pitch (concise), Coach's Corner, The Line | Discovery Questions (fewer, strategic), Landmines (condensed) |
| QBR | Deal Intelligence, Coach's Corner, Meeting Game Plan | What They Need to Believe (condensed), Discovery Questions (expansion-focused) |
| General | All sections at equal weight | None |

#### Document Sections (12 total)

**1. Header**
Meeting title, generation date, meeting type badge (pill label like "Discovery Battle Plan" or "Executive Prep"), duration badge, attendee list with roles.

**2. TL;DR**
2-3 sentence opportunity summary. What's the situation, what's at stake, what's the play. Scannable in 10 seconds.

**3. Stakeholder Map**
Cards for each attendee or known contact, tagged with buying role:
- **Budget Owner** — Controls the money
- **Champion** — Internal advocate, wants you to win
- **Evaluator** — Technical or functional gatekeeper
- **Gatekeeper** — Controls access to decision makers

Each card: name, title, LinkedIn URL (if known), inferred priorities, communication style notes, what they care about.

**4. Their Pain**
Pain points organized by stakeholder or by theme, drawn from:
- User-provided context (transcript, notes, email thread)
- Octave enrichment data
- Findings from prior conversations
- Persona pain points from the matching Motion ICP cell (Pains and consequences)

Each pain point: the pain (their words when possible), the business impact, your response.

**5. What They Need to Believe**
Apply the belief stacking framework from `strategic-coach.md`:
- 5-6 sequential beliefs, each building on the previous
- Each rated: Proven / Mostly Proven / Needs Proof
- Evidence or proof point for each
- Highlight the weakest links — these are the meeting priorities

Visual: color-coded status (green = Proven, yellow = Mostly Proven, red = Needs Proof).

**6. Positioned Sales Pitch**
Apply the 5-step positioned sales pitch from `positioning-coach.md`, scripted for this specific meeting:
1. Set the status quo — "Here's what we see in your world..."
2. Name the problem — "But as [trigger], [what breaks]..."
3. Introduce the category — "That's why [category] exists..."
4. Position in the category — "[Product] is the [differentiator] [category]..."
5. Proof — "[Similar customer] saw [result]..."

Each step includes a scripted talk track (actual words to say) plus a coaching note on delivery. Apply the feature→value→emotion ladder from the positioning framework for every product mention.

**7. Discovery Questions**
Segmented by stakeholder (if attendees are known) or by category. Meeting-type-aware:
- Discovery: full question battery (diagnostic, forcing-function, accountability from `strategic-coach.md`)
- Demo: landmine questions, confirmation questions, "what would make this real?" questions
- Follow-up: progress questions, blocker questions, expansion questions
- Executive: strategic questions, vision questions, decision criteria
- QBR: value realization, adoption, expansion opportunity

8-12 questions max. Each with a brief coaching note on what the answer reveals.

**8. Landmines & Watch-Outs**
Risk/mitigation pairs:
- Competitive traps (things the competitor wants them to ask about)
- Objections likely to surface (with coached responses)
- Topics to avoid or defer
- Signals to watch for (body language, tone shifts, questions they ask)

Visual: two-column layout — Risk | Mitigation.

**9. Coach's Corner**
Two perspectives synthesized from the coaching frameworks:

**Strategic Coach** (from `strategic-coach.md`):
- Ecosystem positioning angle for this account
- Enhancement framing recommendation
- Ideal customer fit assessment
- Guardrail reframe if applicable

**Positioning Coach** (from `positioning-coach.md`):
- Category framing recommendation
- Competitive alternative analysis (what they'd do without you)
- Language to mine from prior context
- Heads on pillows test for this audience

**10. Meeting Game Plan**
Phase-by-phase timeline matched to the meeting duration. Time allocations are proportional:

**30-minute meeting:**
| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Open & Rapport | 0-3 min | Set the frame, confirm agenda |
| Discovery / Pitch | 3-18 min | Core content (meeting-type-dependent) |
| Proof & Stories | 18-23 min | Evidence that lands |
| Next Steps | 23-28 min | Clear commitments |
| Buffer | 28-30 min | Questions, soft close |

**45-minute meeting:**
| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Open & Rapport | 0-5 min | Set the frame, confirm agenda |
| Discovery / Pitch | 5-25 min | Core content |
| Proof & Stories | 25-33 min | Evidence that lands |
| Discussion | 33-40 min | Questions, objection handling |
| Next Steps | 40-45 min | Clear commitments |

**60-minute meeting:**
| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Open & Rapport | 0-5 min | Set the frame, confirm agenda |
| Context Setting | 5-12 min | Status quo, their world |
| Discovery / Pitch | 12-35 min | Core content |
| Proof & Stories | 35-45 min | Evidence that lands |
| Discussion | 45-53 min | Questions, objection handling |
| Next Steps | 53-58 min | Clear commitments |
| Buffer | 58-60 min | Soft close |

**90-minute meeting:**
| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Open & Rapport | 0-7 min | Set the frame, confirm agenda |
| Context Setting | 7-18 min | Status quo, mutual discovery |
| Discovery / Pitch | 18-50 min | Core content (deeper, more interactive) |
| Proof & Stories | 50-62 min | Evidence + customer stories |
| Deep Discussion | 62-75 min | Objections, technical deep-dives |
| Action Planning | 75-85 min | Concrete next steps, timeline |
| Close | 85-90 min | Summary, commitments |

Each phase includes: what to say, what to listen for, and a transition line to the next phase.

**11. Deal Intelligence**
Key deal context at a glance:
- **Budget**: Known budget or budget signals
- **Champion**: Who is championing internally (or "not yet identified")
- **Decision Maker**: Who ultimately signs
- **Compelling Event**: Timeline driver, if any (quarter end, contract renewal, initiative launch)
- **Competition**: Who else is in the deal
- **Stage**: Current deal stage and how long they've been there
- **Next Milestone**: What needs to happen next

If no deal data exists (new prospect), present what's known and flag what to uncover in this meeting.

**12. The Line**
One memorable sentence that captures the strategic essence of this meeting. This is the thing you'd write on a sticky note and put on your monitor before the call. It should distill the entire battle plan into a single actionable insight.

Examples:
- "They believe the problem exists but don't believe anyone's solved it — that's your opening."
- "The VP is bought in; the Director needs proof it won't break their workflow."
- "This is a displacement deal — lead with what they lose by staying, not what they gain by switching."

#### HTML Architecture

See [html-scaffold.md](references/html-scaffold.md) for the full HTML + CSS scaffold of the battle plan document.

#### Content Density Guidelines

Battle plans are reference documents — they should be thorough but scannable:

| Section | Content Limit |
|---------|--------------|
| TL;DR | 2-3 sentences max |
| Stakeholder Map | 4-6 stakeholder cards max |
| Their Pain | 4-6 pain points max |
| What They Need to Believe | 5-6 beliefs max |
| Positioned Sales Pitch | 5 steps, each with 2-3 sentence talk track |
| Discovery Questions | 8-12 questions max |
| Landmines & Watch-Outs | 4-6 risk/mitigation pairs |
| Coach's Corner | 2 perspectives, 3-4 bullets each |
| Meeting Game Plan | 5-7 phases matching duration |
| Deal Intelligence | 6-8 data fields |
| The Line | 1 sentence |

If a section would exceed its limit, prioritize by relevance to the meeting type and trim the rest.

### Step 5: Delivery

After generating the HTML file:

1. **Open the battle plan** in the default browser
2. **Present a summary:**

```
