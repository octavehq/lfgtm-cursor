COACHING MICROSITE OUTLINE

Company: [Company Name]
Stage: [Resonate / Elevate / Compel] — [Stage subLabel]
Coaching Agent: [Agent Name]
Style: [Preset Name]

STRUCTURE
---------
Header + Deal Brief    — Company name, industry, date, coaching stage badge,
                         deal-specific subtitle, deal stats grid
Priority Actions       — 3 quick-hit actions before the next meeting (collapsible)
Deal Activity          — Compact vertical timeline of deal events with dates (collapsible)
Journey Map            — 3-phase coaching journey (Resonate → Elevate → Compel) showing
                         where the deal is and why, with generic phase explanations AND
                         deal-specific context for each phase (collapsible)
Section 01: Stage Assessment     — How stage was inferred, evidence, confidence
Section 02: Buyer Mindset        — Buyer psychology assessment, awareness level, trigger,
                                   constraints, adaptation guidance
Section 03: Value Propositions   — Stage-appropriate props from library with deployment
                                   guidance, evidence inline, usage notes (deploy now vs.
                                   save for later stage vs. already shared)
Section 04: Talking Points       — Stage-specific talk tracks organized by conversation
                                   flow, with strategic point + sample quote + evidence.
                                   Do NOT use framework labels as headers (e.g., "The Shift").
                                   Use practical, deal-specific language.
Section 05: Objection Handling   — Likely objections grounded in buyer's actual decision
                                   frame, with stage-appropriate responses
Section 06: Next Stage Preview   — Transition checklist + next coaching agent preview
[Optional] Section 07: Deal Gaps (MEDDPICC) — Coverage assessment with gap-to-action mapping
The Play               — Strategic one-liner + concrete "your next move is X" action

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------
- The three coaching outputs (Buyer Mindset, Value Props, Talking Points) are the
  organizing principle
- Evidence (proof points, metrics) is folded INTO the relevant sections inline,
  not in a standalone section
- Objections go in Section 05, grounded in the buyer's actual decision frame
  (build vs. buy, do-nothing vs. act, this vendor vs. that)
- MEDDPICC is available as an optional section — not the primary structure
- Talk tracks use a two-layer structure: strategic point (bold, practical deal
  language — NOT framework labels) then sample quote (italic, one way to express it).
  Each includes "Use when..." guidance for timing.
- No duplicate content between sections. Each piece of information appears once.
- Use "perspective-shifting question" framing — tone is collaborative and consultative
- This is a selling tool. Orient language around advancing the deal.
