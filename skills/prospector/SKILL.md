name: prospector
description: Find, enrich, and qualify prospects against your library's ICP criteria.

# /octave:prospector - ICP-Fit Prospecting

Find companies and people that match your Ideal Customer Profile. Uses your library's segments, personas, and Motion ICP cells to search for and score prospects. Returns qualified prospect lists with fit reasoning, recommended approaches, and filter suggestions for scaling in Apollo, Clay, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

## Principles

Follow these standards during generation. Read each before producing output.

**Content and language:**
- [Editorial rules](../shared/editorial-rules.md) — no AI-isms, banned vocabulary, honest analyst tone
- [Information principles](../shared/information-principles.md) — lead with conclusions, evidence-backed claims, narrative arc

**Presentation:**
- [Presentation principles](../shared/presentation-principles.md) — use for any visual output (HTML, dashboards, tables); text follows the editorial rules above

**Octave data:**
- [Octave value](../shared/octave-value.md) — prioritize grounded workspace data over generic AI content

## Usage

```
/octave:prospector [options]
```

## Options

- `--motion <name>` - Scope to a specific Motion's ICP cells (persona × segment matrix)
- `--segment <name>` - Filter by market segment
- `--persona <name>` - Target specific persona type
- `--company <domain>` - Find people at a specific company

```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave:prospector`:

### Step 1: Determine Search Mode

If no options provided, ask:

```
What kind of prospects are you looking for?

1. Companies that fit a Motion's ICP cells (persona × segment matrix)
2. People at a specific company
3. Companies similar to a reference account
4. Open search (I'll help you define criteria)

Your choice:
```

### Step 2: Gather ICP Criteria

Use MCP tools to gather ICP criteria from your library:

**From Motion / Motion ICP cells:**
```
list_motions()
list_motion_icps({ motionOId: "<motion_oId>" })
find_motion_icp({ motionIcpOId: "<motion_icp_oId>", includeLearnings: true })
```

Extract from the Motion ICP cell narrative (Target ICP overview, Operating landscape, Strategic narrative):
- Target segment characteristics (firmographics, industry, signals)
- Buyer persona titles, seniority, department
- Pains and consequences (invert to search signals — companies showing these pains)
- Methodology cues (engagement triggers, qualifying signals)

**From Segment:**
```
get_entity({ oId: "<segment_oId>" })
```

Extract:
- Firmographic criteria (size, industry, location)
- Common characteristics
- Segment-specific signals

**From Persona:**
```
get_entity({ oId: "<persona_oId>" })
```

Extract:
- Common job titles
- Seniority level
- Department/function

### Step 3: Build Search Criteria

Translate library criteria to search parameters:

```
Building Search Criteria
========================

From your library, I'll search for:

Company Criteria:
- Industry: SaaS, Technology
- Size: 100-1000 employees
- Stage: Series A+
- Location: US, UK, Canada

Person Criteria:
- Titles: CTO, VP Engineering, Head of Engineering
- Seniority: VP+
- Department: Engineering, Technology

Derived from:
- Segment: "Scaling SaaS Companies"
- Persona: "CTO - Enterprise Tech"
- Motion: "Enterprise Outbound — DevOps"
- Motion ICP cell: "CTO × Scaling SaaS"

Proceed with this search? (or adjust criteria)
```

### Step 4: Execute Search

**For Company Search:**
```
find_company({
  industry: "<industry>",
  employeeCount: { min: X, max: Y },
  keywords: ["<relevant keywords>"],
  limit: 10
})
```

**For Person Search:**
```
find_person({
  searchMode: "people",
  fuzzyTitles: ["CTO", "VP Engineering"],
  companyDomain: "<domain>",  // if specified
  employeeCount: { min: X, max: Y },
  industry: "<industry>",
  limit: 10
})
```

**For Similar Companies:**
```
find_similar_companies({
  referenceCompany: { domain: "<domain>" },
  numResults: 10,
  similarityTraits: ["industry", "size", "business_model"]
})
```

**For People at Company:**
```
find_person({
  searchMode: "people",
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  fuzzyTitles: ["<titles from persona>"],
  limit: 10
})
```

### Step 5: Score and Present Results

For each result, calculate ICP fit:

**Company Scoring:**
```
qualify_company({
  companyDomain: "<domain>",
  additionalContext: "Evaluating fit for [Motion / Motion ICP cell / segment]"
})
```

**Person Scoring:**
```
qualify_person({
  person: { linkedInProfile: "<url>" },
  additionalContext: "Evaluating fit for [persona] in [Motion ICP cell]"
})
```

Present results:

See [results-output.md](references/results-output.md) for the prospect results template.

### Step 6: Generate Filter Recommendations

After presenting results, provide filters for scale:

See [scale-filters.md](references/scale-filters.md) for the scale-search filter template (Apollo, Clay, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ideal signals).

### Step 7: Deep Dive Options

Offer to go deeper on specific prospects:

**Research Company:**
```
enrich_company({ companyDomain: "techcorp.com" })
```

Present enriched data with:
- Full company profile
- Recent news and events
- Key people and org structure
- Technology stack
- Funding history
- Growth signals

**Find Contacts:**
```
find_person({
  searchMode: "people",
  companyDomain: "techcorp.com",
  fuzzyTitles: ["<persona titles>"],
  limit: 5
})
```

Then for each:
```
enrich_person({
  person: { linkedInProfile: "<url>" }
})
```

**Generate Outreach:**
Suggest running `/octave:generate email` or `/octave:research` for selected prospects.

## Error Handling

**No Results:**
> No companies found matching your criteria.
>
> Try:
> 1. Broadening the search (larger employee range, more industries)
> 2. Removing specific filters
> 3. Using similar-to search with a known good-fit company
>
> Current filters: [show active filters]

**Missing Motion Context:**
> Motion "[name]" not found in your workspace.
>
> Available Motions:
> - Enterprise Outbound
> - SMB Quick Close
> - Healthcare Vertical
>
> Or run /octave:audit to see your library coverage.

**API Limits:**
> Search returned maximum results. Narrow your criteria for more targeted results.
>
> Suggestions:
> - Add industry filter
> - Specify location
> - Use tighter employee range
