### Step 2: Win Factor Analysis

Understand why we won.

- tool: list_findings
- params:
  - query: "why we won decision factors champion value resonated"
  - startDate: "{{period_start}}"
  - eventFilters:
    - outcomeFilters: ["WON"]
- save_as: win_factors
- description: Extract success factors from won deals

### Step 3: Loss Factor Analysis

Understand why we lost.

- tool: list_findings
- params:
  - query: "why we lost objections competitor chosen budget timing"
  - startDate: "{{period_start}}"
  - eventFilters:
    - outcomeFilters: ["LOST"]

### Step 4: Field Intelligence

Surface trends from all conversations.

- tool: list_findings
- params:
  - query: "objections pain points competitor mentions trends"
  - startDate: "{{period_start}}"
- save_as: field_intel
- description: Identify conversation trends, common objections, and emerging patterns

### Step 5: Positive Signals

- tool: list_findings
- params:
  - query: "positive excited interested value proposition resonated"
  - startDate: "{{period_start}}"
  - eventFilters:
    - sentiments: ["POSITIVE"]
- save_as: positive_signals
- description: Identify messaging and value props that are landing well

### Step 6: Get Current ICP

Pull current library definitions for comparison.

- tool: list_all_entities
- params:
  - entityType: "segment"
- save_as: current_segments
- description: Get current ICP segment definitions to compare against deal data

### Step 7: Get Current Personas

Pull persona definitions.

- tool: list_all_entities
- params:
  - entityType: "persona"
- save_as: current_personas
- description: Get current persona definitions for effectiveness analysis

### Step 8: Competitive Landscape

Check competitive activity.

- tool: list_all_entities
- params:
  - entityType: "competitor"
- save_as: competitors
- description: Get all competitors for landscape analysis

### Step 9: Library Health Check

Assess library coverage and freshness via Motions and their Motion Playbooks.

- tool: list_motions
- save_as: motions
- description: Check Motion coverage and identify gaps (a Motion auto-creates a Default Motion Playbook covering the persona × segment matrix; Custom Motion Playbooks layer thematic/account/competitive narratives on top)

### Step 10: Review and Prioritize

Review findings and decide on priorities.

    Top Loss Factor: {{loss_factors[0]}}
    Trending Objection: {{field_intel.top_objection}}
    Best Performing Value Prop: {{positive_signals[0]}}
- options:
