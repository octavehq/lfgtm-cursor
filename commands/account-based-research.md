# Account-Based Research

Build a comprehensive research dossier on a target account. Includes company intelligence, ICP scoring, key contact mapping with enrichment, and matched Motion ICP recommendations. Produces a full account brief without generating outreach.

## Steps

### Step 1: Research Company
tool: enrich_company
params:
  companyDomain: "{{company_domain}}"
save_as: company_profile
description: Get full company intelligence including firmographics, tech stack, recent news, funding history, growth signals, and competitive landscape.

Present a detailed company overview.

### Step 2: Qualify Company
tool: qualify_company
params:
  companyDomain: "{{company_domain}}"
  additionalContext: "Provide detailed segment matching and fit reasoning"
save_as: company_qualification
description: Score the company against all ICP criteria from your library. Identify which segments they match and why.

Present the full qualification breakdown.

### Step 3: Find Key Contacts
tool: find_person
params:
  searchMode: "people"
  companyDomain: "{{company_domain}}"
  limit: "{{num_contacts}}"
save_as: contacts
description: Find key decision-makers and influencers at the company. Search broadly across senior titles to map the buying committee.

Present the list of contacts found.

### Step 4: Enrich Top Contacts
tool: enrich_person
params:
  person:
    linkedInProfile: "{{contact.linkedInProfile}}"
save_as: enriched_contacts
description: Get detailed intelligence on each contact including background, interests, recent activity, and communication preferences.

Run this for each contact found in Step 3 (up to num_contacts). Present enrichment results for each person.

### Step 5: Qualify Contacts
tool: qualify_person
params:
  person:
    linkedInProfile: "{{contact.linkedInProfile}}"
  additionalContext: "Identify which persona from our library this person best matches"
save_as: contact_qualifications
description: Score each contact against persona fit criteria. Identify which library persona they map to and their role in the buying process.

Run this for each enriched contact. Present qualification scores and persona mappings.

### Step 6: Match Motion ICPs
tool: list_motions
save_as: available_motions
description: List Motions available in the workspace to identify which Motion best matches the offering being sold into this account.

Then for the selected Motion:

tool: list_motion_icps
params:
  motionOId: "{{selected_motion_oId}}"
save_as: motion_icp_matrix
description: Get the persona × segment matrix for this Motion.

For each persona matched in Step 5, fetch the Motion ICP cell that intersects with the company's segment:

tool: find_motion_icp
params:
  motionIcpOId: "{{persona_segment_motion_icp_oId}}"
  includeLearnings: true
save_as: matched_motion_icps
description: Pull the full Motion ICP narrative (Target ICP overview, Operating landscape, Strategic narrative, Pains and consequences, Benefits and impacts, Methodology, References) plus Learning Loop learnings for each relevant persona × segment cell.

Present the matched Motion ICP cells with their strategic narrative and which personas they map to.
